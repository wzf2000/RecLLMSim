Here are some specific recommendations for accommodations and transportation:\n\nIn Bali, for a serene beachfront experience, you might consider the Nusa Dua area. The Mulia Bali and The St. Regis Bali Resort are both highly regarded luxury beachfront resorts. If you prefer a more secluded and intimate atmosphere, you could look into guesthouses like The Kayon Resort or Alam Ubud Culture Villas & Residences, which offer a serene ambiance surrounded by nature.\n\nIn Chiang Mai, there are several cooking classes you can consider. The Thai Farm Cooking School, Asia Scenic Thai Cooking School, and Baan Thai Cookery School are all popular options. They offer hands-on experiences where you can learn to prepare traditional Thai dishes using fresh ingredients from local markets.\n\nIn Barcelona, if you're looking for hotels with easy access to both the city center and the beaches, consider the Barceloneta neighborhood. Hotel Arts Barcelona and W Barcelona are both luxury hotels located right on the beachfront. They offer stunning views and convenient access to both the city's attractions and the beach.\n\nIn Queenstown, New Zealand, there are several reputable car rental companies to choose from. Avis, Hertz, and Budget are well-known international companies with offices in Queenstown. For a more local experience, you can also consider companies like Apex Car Rentals or Jucy Rentals. Make sure to book your car in advance, especially during peak travel seasons.\n\nWhen using public transportation within each location, be sure to familiarize yourself with the local systems. For example, in Tokyo, the subway system is extensive and efficient. In Marrakech, you can utilize taxis or horse-drawn carriages known as \"caleches\" for getting around the city.\n\nRemember to check the local COVID-19 guidelines and travel restrictions closer to your travel dates to ensure a smooth and safe journey.
