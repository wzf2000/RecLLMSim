Sedona to Bali:\n- Fly from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX) to Ngurah Rai International Airport (DPS) in Denpasar, Bali.\n- There are no direct flights between Phoenix and Bali, so you'll likely have a layover or two.

Bali to Sedona:\n- Fly from Ngurah Rai International Airport (DPS) to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX).\n- Again, there are no direct flights, so you'll likely have a layover or two.\n- The total travel time is similar to the journey from Sedona to Bali, taking around 20-25 hours.\n\nTo make the most of your time during the trip, it's recommended to plan your flights in a way that minimizes layover times and provides ample time to rest and recover from jet lag.
