Buses are a good option for reaching specific destinations or exploring neighborhoods that are not easily accessible by subway.\n\n3. Walking: Boston is a walkable city, especially in the downtown area and historic districts. Many attractions, such as the Freedom Trail, are within walking distance of each other. Walking allows you to soak in the city's charm and discover hidden gems along the way.\n\n4.
