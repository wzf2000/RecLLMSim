Rest and relaxation: While it's exciting to have a packed itinerary, don't forget to factor in some downtime for rest and relaxation. Allow yourself some leisurely moments to soak in the atmosphere, enjoy local cuisine, or simply unwind in your cozy accommodations.\n\n5. Local recommendations: Once you have a more finalized itinerary, consider reaching out to locals or researching online for additional recommendations specific to each destination.
