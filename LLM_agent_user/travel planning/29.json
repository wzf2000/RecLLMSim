These towns are located on the northern side of the island, closer to the Teide Observatory. You'll find accommodations with a local charm and easy access to both the observatory and other attractions.\n\nIf you prefer a more luxurious experience, you might want to explore resorts and hotels in the southern part of the island, near Costa Adeje or Playa de las Américas. These areas offer beautiful beachfront properties, upscale amenities, and convenient access to various dining options.\n\nAs for transportation, renting a car would be the most convenient option for exploring Tenerife. It will give you the freedom to visit the observatory, explore the island's stunning landscapes, and reach different dining establishments at your own pace. The roads in Tenerife are well-maintained, and the island is relatively small, making it easy to navigate.\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer not to drive, you can rely on public transportation, such as buses, which connect different parts of the island. However, keep in mind that the frequency of buses may vary, and some remote areas may be less accessible.\n\nOnce you have an idea of your preferred accommodation style and transportation option, we can move on to creating a detailed itinerary that includes stargazing activities, dining experiences, and other attractions you'd like to explore on the island.
