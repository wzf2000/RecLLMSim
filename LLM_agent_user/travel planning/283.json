How about visiting the Pacific Northwest region of the United States?

This diverse park offers breathtaking views of mountains, forests, and coastal areas. You can go hiking on the various trails, explore the Hoh Rainforest, and even take a scenic drive along Hurricane Ridge for panoramic views.\n\nAnother option is Crater Lake National Park in Oregon. This park is famous for its deep blue lake, formed in the caldera of an ancient volcano. You can take a boat tour on the lake, hike around the rim, or simply relax and soak in the serene surroundings.\n\nFor accommodations, both parks offer camping options if you enjoy being close to nature. However, if you prefer more comfort, there are also lodges and hotels nearby.\n\nAs for transportation, renting a car would be the most convenient way to explore these national parks. It will give you the flexibility to move around at your own pace and fully enjoy the scenic drives.\n\nLet me know if any of these options appeal to you, and we can further discuss the details and create an itinerary that suits your preferences!",
