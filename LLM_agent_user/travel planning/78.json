Keep in mind that driving in New Zealand is on the left side of the road, so make sure you're comfortable with that if you choose this option.\n\n2. Public Transportation: Queenstown has a reliable public bus system called Connectabus, which operates throughout the town and surrounding areas. This is a cost-effective option if you prefer not to drive. The bus service connects major attractions and can take you to places like Arrowtown, Lake Hayes, and the Remarkables Ski Area.\n\n3. Taxis and Rideshares: Taxis and rideshare services like Uber are available in Queenstown, offering convenient transportation within the town and to nearby destinations.
