From there, you can rent a car or take a shuttle service to Banff, which is approximately a 1.5-hour drive away.

Several companies offer this service, and it's a comfortable and hassle-free way to reach your destination. The journey takes around 1.5 to 2 hours, depending on traffic and weather conditions.\n\nOnce you're in Banff, the town is relatively compact and easily walkable, so you can explore the main attractions on foot. If you plan to venture further into Banff National Park or visit attractions outside the town, renting a car or booking organized tours would be the most convenient options.\n\nI hope this helps!
