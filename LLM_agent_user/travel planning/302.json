Denver offers a great mix of outdoor activities, live music events, and beautiful scenic drives nearby.\n\nDay 1: \n- Start your day with a visit to Rocky Mountain National Park, located just a couple of hours from Denver. You can go hiking on one of the park's many trails, enjoy the breathtaking views, and maybe even try some snowshoeing if conditions allow.\n- After spending the morning in the park, head back to Denver and explore the city. Visit the Denver Art Museum, stroll through the historic Larimer Square, or check out the trendy neighborhoods like LoDo (Lower Downtown) or RiNo (River North Art District).\n- In the evening, catch a live music performance at one of Denver's iconic venues like the Bluebird Theater or the Fillmore Auditorium.\n\nDay 2:\n- Start your day by hitting the slopes! There are several ski resorts near Denver, such as Breckenridge, Keystone, or Winter Park. You can rent equipment and spend the day snowboarding or skiing.\n- If you're not into skiing, you can opt for a scenic drive through the stunning landscapes of the Rocky Mountains. The Mount Evans Scenic Byway is a great choice, offering breathtaking views and the opportunity to spot wildlife.\n- In the evening, check out the local music scene. Denver has a vibrant live music culture, with plenty of venues showcasing various genres. Check the schedules of places like the Ogden Theatre or the Red Rocks Amphitheatre for any concerts or events happening during your visit.\n\nFor accommodations, Denver has a range of options to suit your budget. You can find affordable hostels in the downtown area or consider sharing a room with friends to keep costs down.\n\nAs for transportation, renting a car would be ideal for exploring the scenic drives and accessing the ski resorts. Denver is known for its beautiful mountainous surroundings, so a road trip would be a great way to experience the area.\n\nI hope this itinerary gives you a good starting point for your trip planning.
