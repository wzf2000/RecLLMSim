This option is hassle-free and eliminates the need for driving.\n\nOnce you arrive in Banff, Moraine Lake Lodge is approximately a 30-minute drive from the town of Banff. You can either rent a car locally, take a taxi, or use shuttle services that operate within Banff National Park.\n\nAdditionally, within Banff National Park, there is a shuttle service called Roam Transit that connects various points of interest. While it doesn't go directly to Moraine Lake, it can be useful for exploring other areas of the park without the need for a car.\n\nI hope this helps you plan your transportation to Banff.
