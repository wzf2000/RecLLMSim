As for music festivals, there are a few notable ones that take place in the region during the summer. Here are a couple you might consider:\n\n1. Bumbershoot Festival (Seattle, Washington): This annual music and arts festival typically takes place over Labor Day weekend (early September), so if your trip coincides with that, you could extend your stay to attend. Bumbershoot features a diverse lineup of artists from various genres, along with comedy shows, art exhibits, and more.\n\n2. Pickathon (Happy Valley, Oregon): Held just outside of Portland, Pickathon is a unique festival that focuses on indie, folk, and alternative music. It takes place in late July or early August and offers a charming setting with multiple stages set amidst the woods. The festival also emphasizes sustainability and has a strong commitment to eco-friendly practices.\n\nWhile these festivals might not align perfectly with your two-day itinerary, you could consider adjusting your trip dates or extending your stay to include one of these events.
