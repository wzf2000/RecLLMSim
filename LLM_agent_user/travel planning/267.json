Based on your interest in hiking and fishing, I have a couple of suggestions for you.\n\n1. Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA:\nYellowstone is known for its stunning geothermal features, including the famous Old Faithful geyser. It offers numerous hiking trails of varying difficulty levels, allowing you to explore its diverse ecosystems. The park also has several lakes and rivers where you can enjoy fishing.\n\n2. Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada:\nBanff is a paradise for outdoor enthusiasts. It's nestled in the Canadian Rockies, offering jaw-dropping mountain scenery, turquoise lakes, and abundant wildlife. The park has an extensive network of hiking trails, ranging from easy walks to challenging hikes. You can also enjoy fishing in the lakes and rivers within the park.\n\nIn terms of accommodations, both parks have campgrounds where you can set up your tent and enjoy the full camping experience. Alternatively, you can find cozy lodges or cabins nearby if you prefer a bit more comfort.\n\nFor transportation, renting a car would be ideal as it gives you the flexibility to explore the park at your own pace. Just make sure to check the specific regulations and guidelines for each park regarding fishing permits and any restrictions on certain areas.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more information on either of these options or if you have any other preferences I can take into account while refining your itinerary!",

The lower falls are just a 1.1-kilometer (0.7-mile) walk from the trailhead, while the upper falls are an additional 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) away. The trail is well-maintained and relatively easy, making it perfect for a shorter hike.\n\n2. Lake Agnes Tea House and Big Beehive:\nThis hike starts at Lake Louise and takes you up to the Lake Agnes Tea House, where you can enjoy a refreshing beverage and stunning views. From there, you can continue up to the Big Beehive for even more panoramic vistas. The round trip is approximately 9 kilometers (5.6 miles), and while it's a bit more challenging, the scenery makes it well worth the effort.\n\nAs for fishing spots, there are several lakes and rivers within Banff National Park where you can cast your line. Some notable fishing locations include Lake Minnewanka, Bow River, and the Spray Lakes. Just remember to obtain the necessary fishing permits and adhere to the park's regulations.\n\nWith these hiking trails and fishing spots in mind, you can plan your itinerary accordingly.
