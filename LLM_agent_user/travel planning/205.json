Wanaka: Similar to Queenstown, public transportation is available, but renting a car would provide more flexibility to explore the stunning landscapes and nearby attractions.\n\n6. Fiordland National Park: For Fiordland National Park, you can join organized tours or take a bus to reach Milford Sound or Doubtful Sound. Alternatively, you can rent a car and drive to these destinations, which allows for more flexibility in terms of stops along the way.\n\nRenting a car for specific parts of your trip, such as in Queenstown and Wanaka, would give you the freedom to explore the beautiful landscapes and access hiking trails more easily.
