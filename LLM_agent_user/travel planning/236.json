It allows you to cover large distances quickly and gives you more time to explore your destinations. There are several well-connected airports in Europe and Southeast Asia, making it convenient to fly between major cities.\n\nIn Europe, you can consider flying between cities like Paris, Rome, and Barcelona. Airlines such as Air France, Alitalia, and Vueling offer regular flights between these destinations. It's a good idea to check for direct flights and compare prices to find the most convenient options.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, flying is also a popular choice for longer distances. Bangkok, Hanoi, and Siem Reap are well-connected by major airlines such as Thai Airways, Vietnam Airlines, and Cambodia Angkor Air. Look for direct flights or consider connecting flights if they offer better options in terms of timing and cost.\n\nFor shorter distances or when traveling within a country, trains can be a convenient and enjoyable mode of transportation. Europe, in particular, has an extensive and efficient rail network, making it easy to travel between cities.
