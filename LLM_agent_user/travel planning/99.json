Guided Tours: Another option is to join guided tours or excursions that take you to various points of interest in Banff National Park. These tours often include transportation and are a great way to learn about the park's history, wildlife, and highlights from knowledgeable guides.\n\nIt's worth noting that during peak season, the park can get quite busy, so it's advisable to plan your transportation in advance and be prepared for potential crowds.
