Bus: Paris has an extensive bus network that can be a scenic way to explore the city. Buses cover areas that the metro doesn't, and they offer a chance to see the city above ground. The same Paris Visite pass mentioned earlier can be used for bus travel as well.\n\n3. RER Trains: The RER trains are regional express trains that connect Paris to its suburbs and nearby attractions like Versailles and Disneyland Paris. If you plan to visit any of these destinations, the RER trains are a convenient option.\n\n4. Taxis and Ride-Sharing: Taxis are readily available in Paris, and you can easily hail them on the street or find them at designated taxi stands. Additionally, ride-sharing services like Uber and Bolt are popular and widely available in the city.\n\nWhen it comes to passes or cards, the Paris Visite pass I mentioned earlier can be a good option if you plan to use public transportation frequently. It offers flexibility and convenience, allowing you to travel freely without worrying about individual tickets.\n\nAnother option to consider is the Paris Museum Pass, which provides access to numerous museums and monuments in Paris. This can be beneficial if you plan to visit multiple attractions during your two-day trip.\n\nLastly, if you prefer cycling, Paris has a bike-sharing system called Vélib' that allows you to rent bikes for short periods. It can be a fun and eco-friendly way to explore the city.\n\nConsider your transportation needs and preferences, and decide which options align best with your itinerary.",
