You could start in Seattle, Washington, and explore Olympic National Park for hiking and camping. Then, drive down the Oregon coast, stopping at places like Cannon Beach and Newport. Finally, visit Portland for its vibrant food scene and cultural attractions.\n\n2. Banff National Park, Canada: Located in Alberta, Banff National Park is a paradise for outdoor enthusiasts. You can hike through breathtaking landscapes, kayak on turquoise lakes, and even spot wildlife. The town of Banff offers a range of accommodations, from campgrounds to luxury resorts.\n\n3. Iceland: Known for its dramatic landscapes, Iceland is a nature lover's dream. You can rent a car and drive the famous Ring Road, which circles the entire island.
