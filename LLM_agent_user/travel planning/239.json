Rental Car: Renting a car will give you the freedom to explore at your own pace and reach more remote areas. It's a popular choice in New Zealand, and the roads are well-maintained. Just keep in mind that winter driving conditions may require extra caution.\n\n2. Intercity Buses: New Zealand has a reliable network of intercity buses that connect major towns and cities. This option is more budget-friendly compared to renting a car, and it allows you to relax and enjoy the scenic views while someone else does the driving.\n\nNorway:\n1. Train: Norway has an extensive train network that covers major cities and scenic routes. The trains are comfortable, and you can enjoy the breathtaking landscapes from the window. Consider the Flåm Railway or the Bergen Railway for stunning views.\n\n2. Hurtigruten Coastal Voyage: If you're planning to explore the Norwegian fjords, consider taking a cruise with Hurtigruten. This coastal voyage allows you to experience the beauty of the fjords while traveling between different ports.\n\n3. Rental Car: Renting a car in Norway offers flexibility and convenience, especially if you plan to explore remote areas or venture off the beaten path. Just be aware that winter driving conditions can be challenging, so make sure you're prepared and have appropriate winter tires.\n\nIn both countries, it's important to check the local weather and road conditions, especially during winter, as they can impact your travel plans.
