Renting a car: Renting a car gives you the freedom to explore at your own pace and access remote areas. It's a convenient option for driving along the scenic routes of the Icefields Parkway, which connects Banff and Jasper National Parks.\n\n2. Public transportation: In the Canadian Rockies, there are bus services available, such as the Roam Transit and Parks Canada shuttles, which can take you to popular destinations within the national parks. However, note that these services may have limited schedules and routes.\n\nNorway:\n1. Renting a car: Renting a car is a popular option in Norway, as it allows you to explore the stunning fjords and countryside at your own pace. The roads are well-maintained, and driving offers flexibility to stop and enjoy the scenic routes.\n\n2. Public transportation: Norway has an extensive public transportation network, including trains, buses, and ferries. The train routes in Norway, such as the Flåm Railway, offer breathtaking views. Buses and ferries can take you to more remote areas and islands.\n\n3. Hurtigruten coastal voyage: If you're interested in a unique experience, consider taking a Hurtigruten coastal voyage. This cruise-like ferry service travels along the Norwegian coast, allowing you to enjoy the fjords and visit various ports.\n\nBoth destinations offer diverse transportation options, so it ultimately depends on your preferences and comfort level.
