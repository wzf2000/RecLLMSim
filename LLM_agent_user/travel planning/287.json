When it comes to accommodations, there are plenty of options to consider.\n\nFor a cozy and comfortable stay close to hiking trails, you might want to look into booking lodges, cabins, or even eco-friendly accommodations. In New Zealand, there are many lodges and cabins located near popular hiking areas, offering a blend of comfort and proximity to nature. Some well-regarded options include the Milford Sound Lodge in Fiordland National Park, the Aoraki Mount Cook Alpine Lodge near Mount Cook, and the Abel Tasman Lodge in Abel Tasman National Park.\n\nAdditionally, New Zealand has a great selection of eco-lodges and boutique accommodations that provide a unique and sustainable experience. These places often emphasize environmental conservation and offer a more intimate connection with nature. Examples include the Hapuku Lodge in Kaikoura and the Aro Hā Wellness Retreat near Queenstown.\n\nNow, let's talk about transportation. To access the different hiking spots, renting a car or campervan is a popular choice in New Zealand. It gives you the flexibility to explore at your own pace and access remote areas. There are several reliable rental companies available, such as JUCY, Britz, and Apollo. Just make sure to familiarize yourself with New Zealand's road rules and driving conditions, as they can be different from what you're used to.\n\nIf you prefer not to drive, there are also public transportation options available, including buses and trains. Intercity and KiwiRail are two popular operators that cover various regions in New Zealand.\n\nConsidering the duration of your trip, I would suggest spending around 10 days on the South Island, exploring areas like Fiordland National Park, Mount Cook, and Abel Tasman National Park. The remaining days can be spent on the North Island, where you can visit places like Tongariro National Park, the Bay of Islands, and the Coromandel Peninsula.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with your planning!
