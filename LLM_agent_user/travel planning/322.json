Some lodges even offer transport to the start and end points of the Tongariro Alpine Crossing.\n\n3. Routeburn Track: Similar to the Milford Track, the Routeburn Track also has DOC huts along the trail. These huts provide a rustic experience and are a great way to meet fellow hikers. However, if you prefer a more comfortable option, there are also luxury lodges nearby, such as the Routeburn Falls Lodge or the Kinloch Lodge.\n\nFor other areas, such as Rotorua, Franz Josef, and Queenstown, you'll find a wide range of accommodations to suit your preferences, from hotels and resorts to holiday parks and campsites. Some campsites even offer unique experiences, such as thermal hot pools in Rotorua or scenic views in Franz Josef.\n\nWhen booking accommodations, it's advisable to make reservations in advance, especially for popular destinations and during peak travel seasons.
