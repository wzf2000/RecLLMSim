Allocating 2-3 hours each evening and longer sessions on weekends sounds like a reasonable schedule given your busy work routine. Consistency is key, so try to stick to the schedule you've set for yourself. Remember to take breaks and give yourself some time to relax as well.\n\nIncorporating architectural elements into your video editing practice is a great idea! Here are a few suggestions on how you can integrate your architectural work or interests into the learning process:\n\n1. Use architectural footage: Capture videos of architectural structures, buildings, or spaces that interest you. You can then incorporate these videos into your editing projects, experimenting with different techniques and effects to showcase the beauty and design elements of the architecture.\n\n2. Create architectural walkthroughs: Use 3D modeling software to create virtual architectural walkthroughs or fly-throughs. You can then import these into your video editing software and enhance them with effects, transitions, and music to create visually appealing presentations.\n\n3. Tell architectural stories: Use video editing to tell stories about architectural projects or concepts. You can combine interviews, footage, and animations to create engaging narratives that highlight the design process, inspirations, and challenges faced in architectural projects.\n\n4. Experiment with visual effects: Explore video editing techniques that can enhance architectural visuals. For example, you can experiment with color grading to create a specific mood or atmosphere, or use motion graphics to overlay architectural plans, diagrams, or annotations onto footage.\n\n5. Collaborate with other architects or designers: Connect with other architects or designers who are interested in video editing. You can collaborate on projects, share ideas, and learn from each other's experiences. This can be a great way to expand your network and gain insights into different approaches to incorporating architecture into video editing.\n\nRemember, the key is to have fun and be creative with your video editing projects. Don't be afraid to experiment and try new things. Good luck, and I hope your video editing journey with architectural elements turns out to be a fulfilling and enjoyable experience!",
