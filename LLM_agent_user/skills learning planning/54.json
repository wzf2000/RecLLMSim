With 30 minutes a day and an hour on weekends, you'll be able to make steady progress. Now, let's break down your learning plan into different components to make it more manageable.\n\n1. Vocabulary: Start by building your foundational vocabulary. Aim to learn 5-10 new words or phrases every day. You can use flashcards, mobile apps like Duolingo or Memrise, or even create your own vocabulary lists.\n\n2. Grammar: Familiarize yourself with basic grammar concepts. Focus on topics like verb conjugation, noun-adjective agreement, and sentence structure. Online resources like websites, grammar books, or language learning platforms such as Babbel or Rosetta Stone can be helpful.\n\n3. Listening and Speaking: Practice listening to native French speakers to improve your comprehension skills. You can watch French movies, TV shows, or listen to podcasts or music. Additionally, try speaking aloud to practice pronunciation. Language exchange platforms like Tandem or HelloTalk can connect you with native French speakers for conversation practice.\n\n4. Reading: Start with simple texts like children's books or graded readers. As you progress, you can move on to newspapers, magazines, or online articles. Reading will help expand your vocabulary and improve your understanding of sentence structure.\n\n5. Writing: Practice writing short paragraphs or journal entries in French. You can use language learning apps or websites that offer writing exercises or find a language exchange partner who can provide feedback on your writing.\n\n6. Cultural Immersion: Immerse yourself in French culture by watching French movies, listening to French music, or exploring French cuisine. This will give you a deeper understanding of the language and its context.\n\nRemember to be consistent and have fun with your learning!
