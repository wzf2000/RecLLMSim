They are indeed valuable resources for learning French.\n\nWhen it comes to the number of hours you should dedicate to learning French per week, it really depends on your schedule and how quickly you want to progress. However, consistency is key, so aim for at least 30 minutes to an hour of focused learning each day. This regular practice will help you retain the information better and make steady progress.\n\nAs for reaching a conversational level in French, it's difficult to give an exact timeframe as it varies from person to person. However, with consistent effort and practice, you can expect to have basic conversations within a few months of dedicated learning. Keep in mind that language learning is a gradual process, and progress may feel slower at times. Don't get discouraged and celebrate small victories along the way.\n\nTo supplement your learning, try to immerse yourself in the language as much as possible. Listen to French music, watch movies or TV shows with French subtitles, and engage with French-speaking communities online or in person. This exposure to the language will help you improve your comprehension and cultural understanding.\n\nRemember, the key is to enjoy the process and stay motivated.
