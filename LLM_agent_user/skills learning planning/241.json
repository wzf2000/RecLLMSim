I'd be happy to help you create a comprehensive learning plan and suggest some effective resources.\n\nTo start, let's break down your learning plan into a few key components: \n\n1. Vocabulary and Grammar: Begin by focusing on building a solid foundation of vocabulary and grammar. Start with basic words and phrases, and gradually expand your knowledge. Familiarize yourself with verb conjugations, sentence structures, and common grammatical rules.\n\n2. Listening and Speaking: Practice your listening and speaking skills regularly. This can be done through listening to audio lessons, podcasts, or watching French movies and TV shows with subtitles. Engage in conversation with native speakers whenever possible, either through language exchange platforms or by joining language groups in your area.\n\n3. Reading: Read French texts, such as books, newspapers, or online articles, to improve your comprehension and expand your vocabulary. Start with simpler texts and gradually progress to more challenging ones.\n\n4. Writing: Practice your writing skills by keeping a journal in French, writing short stories, or participating in online language forums. This will help reinforce what you've learned and improve your ability to express yourself in writing.\n\nNow, let's discuss some effective resources to aid your learning:\n\n1. Language Learning Apps: Duolingo, Memrise, and Babbel are popular apps that offer structured lessons, vocabulary practice, and interactive exercises.\n\n2. Online Courses: Platforms like Coursera and edX offer French language courses taught by experienced instructors. They often include video lectures, quizzes, and assignments.\n\n3. Textbooks: Consider using textbooks like \"Assimil\" or \"Teach Yourself French\" to provide a structured learning path and exercises.\n\n4. Language Exchanges: Websites like iTalki and Tandem allow you to connect with native French speakers for language exchange sessions via video calls.\n\n5. Online Resources: Websites such as FluentU, Kwiziq, and Lingoda offer a variety of resources, including video lessons, grammar exercises, and language proficiency tests.\n\nRemember to set aside regular study time each day or week, depending on your schedule. Consistency is key to making progress. Additionally, immerse yourself in the language as much as possible by listening to French music, podcasts, and radio stations.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you get started on your French learning journey! Bonne chance (good luck) and have fun!",
