Ideally, aim for at least a few hours each week dedicated to practicing video editing. Consistency is key, so try to establish a routine that works for you. It's better to practice regularly for shorter periods than to cram a lot of practice into a single session.\n\nAs for projects and exercises, here are a few recommendations to help you apply the techniques and concepts you learn:\n\n1. Edit existing footage: Find raw footage from various sources, such as stock footage websites or open-source projects, and practice editing them. This will allow you to experiment with different editing styles, transitions, effects, and storytelling techniques.\n\n2. Recreate scenes from movies or TV shows: Choose a scene from your favorite movie or TV show and try to recreate it as closely as possible. This exercise will help you analyze the editing techniques used in professional productions and challenge you to replicate them.\n\n3. Create a showreel or montage: Gather your best work or footage from various projects and create a showreel or montage that showcases your skills. This exercise will require you to carefully select and edit footage to create a visually appealing and engaging compilation.\n\n4. Collaborate with others: Reach out to fellow creatives, such as filmmakers or content creators, and offer your video editing skills to collaborate on projects. This will give you the opportunity to work on real-world projects and gain experience in a collaborative environment.\n\n5. Experiment with different genres: Try editing videos in different genres, such as documentaries, music videos, short films, or vlogs. Each genre has its own unique editing style and requirements, allowing you to broaden your skillset and adapt to different storytelling techniques.\n\nRemember, the more you practice and apply what you learn, the better you'll become. Don't be afraid to make mistakes and learn from them. It's through experimentation and hands-on experience that you'll truly grow as a video editor. Enjoy the process and have fun exploring your creativity!",
