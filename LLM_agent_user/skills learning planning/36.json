Here's a suggested way to divide your study time throughout the week:\n\n1. Aim for consistency: It's generally beneficial to have regular practice sessions, so try to study French every day if possible. This will help reinforce what you've learned and maintain a steady progress.\n\n2. Break it down: Divide your daily study time into smaller, manageable sessions. For example, you could have two 30-minute sessions or four 15-minute sessions. This will help you stay focused and prevent burnout.\n\n3. Mix it up: Vary your activities during each study session. Spend some time on vocabulary, grammar, listening exercises, and speaking practice. This way, you'll cover multiple aspects of language learning and keep things interesting.\n\n4. Set specific study days: If daily practice becomes too challenging due to your schedule, consider setting specific study days. For instance, you could allocate more time on weekends or choose specific days during the week when you can dedicate longer sessions to learning French.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a schedule that works best for you and allows you to maintain consistency. Adapt it as needed to fit your lifestyle and commitments.
