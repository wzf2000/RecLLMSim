I'm familiar with video editing and can definitely assist you in creating a learning plan and finding suitable resources. To start, let's break down the process into a few steps:\n\n1. Define your goals: Determine what you want to achieve with video editing. Do you want to edit short films, create YouTube videos, or maybe work on professional projects? Having a clear goal will help you focus your efforts.\n\n2. Identify your current skill level: Since you mentioned having some experience, it's important to assess your current skill level. This will help you gauge where you stand and what areas you need to work on. Knowing your strengths and weaknesses will guide your learning plan.\n\n3. Choose a video editing software: There are several popular video editing software options available, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, and DaVinci Resolve. If you're already familiar with one, you can continue using it. Otherwise, consider exploring different software options and choose one that suits your needs and budget.\n\n4. Learn the basics: Start by understanding the fundamental concepts of video editing, such as different types of cuts, transitions, and effects. You can find online tutorials, courses, or even books that cover the basics. Websites like YouTube, Lynda.com, and Udemy offer a wide range of video editing tutorials.\n\n5. Practice with projects: Put your skills into action by working on small projects. This could include editing existing footage, creating short videos, or even collaborating with others on small projects. Practicing regularly will help you improve and gain confidence.\n\n6. Expand your knowledge: Once you have a solid foundation, explore more advanced techniques, such as color grading, audio editing, and motion graphics. These skills will enhance the quality of your edits and make your videos more engaging.\n\n7. Join communities and seek feedback: Engage with other video editors by joining online communities, forums, or social media groups. Sharing your work and seeking feedback from experienced editors can provide valuable insights and help you grow.\n\nRemember, learning video editing is an iterative process, so be patient with yourself. Now, if you have any specific questions or need help finding learning resources, feel free to ask!",
