It sounds like a solid approach to developing my video editing skills. \n\nIn terms of my current skill level, I have some experience with Adobe Premiere Pro and have edited a few videos using basic editing techniques like trimming, adding transitions, and adjusting audio levels. However, I haven't delved into more advanced features like color grading, special effects, or working with different video formats. So, I would consider myself at a beginner to intermediate level.\n\nFor the next six months, I have a few goals in mind. Firstly, I want to become proficient in using Adobe Premiere Pro and expand my knowledge of its advanced features. Secondly, I'd like to learn about color grading techniques to enhance the visual quality of my videos. Lastly, I want to gain experience in editing different types of videos, such as vlogs, short films, and promotional videos.\n\nNow, let's move on to exploring the available resources.
