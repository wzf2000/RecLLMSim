December is also a great time to visit since the weather is mild.\n\n2. **Palm Springs, California** - If you're into a desert oasis vibe, Palm Springs is about a 2-hour drive from LA. It's known for its mid-century modern architecture, artsy scene, and poolside chill spots. While there might not be a music festival in December, the local venues often have live music.\n\n3. **Joshua Tree, California** - About a 3-hour drive from LA, Joshua Tree is perfect for those who love nature and music. You can visit the Joshua Tree National Park during the day and explore the small music venues at night.\n\n4. **Santa Barbara, California** - A 2-hour drive up the coast will take you to Santa Barbara, which has a great local music scene, amazing food, and wine tasting opportunities.\n\n5. **Las Vegas, Nevada** - Vegas is about a 4-hour drive and is the ultimate party destination. There's always a show or concert happening, and the food scene ranges from buffets to gourmet fast food. The weather in December is cooler but not too cold, perfect for exploring the Strip.\n\nConsidering your budget, here's a simple plan for a 3-day trip:\n\n**Day 1:**\n- Leave early in the morning.\n- Stop for fast food along the way; In-N-Out Burger is a classic California choice.\n- Arrive at the destination by noon.\n- Check into a budget-friendly hotel or motel.\n- Spend the afternoon exploring local attractions.\n- Enjoy a live music gig in the evening.\n- Experience some local cuisine for dinner.\n\n**Day 2:**\n- Daytime exploration, such as hiking in Joshua Tree or lounging on a San Diego beach.\n- Grab fast food or street food for lunch.\n- More exploration or relaxation in the afternoon.\n- Another live music event or night out.\n\n**Day 3:**\n- A leisurely morning and breakfast.\n- Check out of the hotel.\n- Maybe hit one last local spot before hitting the road.\n- Stop for fast food on the drive back to LA.\n\n**Accommodation Tips:**\n- Consider staying in hostels, motels, or checking out Airbnb for shared accommodations to stay within budget.\n- Book in advance to get the best deals.\n\n**Transportation:**\n- Since you're driving, make sure the car is in good condition for the road trip.\n- Split gas and parking fees among the four of you to keep costs down.\n\nRemember to check for any specific events or gigs happening during the time you plan to visit, and book tickets in advance if necessary. Keep an eye out for special deals or student discounts. Have a fantastic trip!",

Check out USA Hostels Ocean Beach or HI San Diego Downtown.\n- Budget Hotels: Look for hotels in Hotel Circle; they often have competitive prices. Try the Kings Inn or the Mission Valley Resort.\n- Airbnb: You can find a shared room or even a whole apartment if you book early. Opt for locations like Pacific Beach, Ocean Beach, or the Gaslamp Quarter for a central location close to the action.\n\nAlways read recent reviews, check for free Wi-Fi, breakfast options, and parking availability when booking your accommodation.\n\n**Music Events or Festivals:**\n- San Diego's event calendars are full of live music and events. Check platforms like Eventbrite or the San Diego Reader for listings closer to your trip date.\n- Visit local music venues like The Casbah, House of Blues, or Belly Up Tavern for live gigs.\n- In December, there might be holiday-themed events, which can also be a lot of fun.\n\n**Fast Food Recommendations for the Road Trip:**\n- In-N-Out Burger: It's a California classic and great for a quick, tasty burger.\n- The Habit Burger Grill: Another solid choice for burgers and sandwiches, plus it originated in California.\n- Rubio's Coastal Grill: Known for its fish tacos and a good pit stop for a taste of San Diego's seafood scene even before you arrive.\n- Chipotle: For a quick, customizable Mexican-inspired meal.\n- Lastly, don't miss out on trying some local Southern California fast food chains like Jack in the Box or Del Taco.\n\nMake sure to bring a cooler with snacks and drinks to keep energy levels up and costs down during your drive. It's also a good idea to have a playlist of your favorite tunes ready to set the mood for your road trip.\n\nBefore you finalize everything, here are a few more tips:\n- Book your accommodation as soon as possible to ensure availability and best prices.\n- Keep an eye out for early bird tickets for any events you decide to attend.\n- Make sure your vehicle is checked and ready for the road trip (tire pressure, oil, coolant levels, etc.).\n- Check the COVID-19 regulations and guidelines for San Diego as the date approaches.\n\nWith all these elements in place, you're well on your way to a memorable trip to San Diego with your friends!

Managing finances among friends on a trip can indeed be a bit tricky, but with a bit of organization, it can go smoothly. Here are some tips for splitting costs effectively:\n\n1. **Discuss Budgets Upfront**: Before booking anything, have an honest discussion about everyone's budget. This ensures that the plans you make are comfortable for all participants.\n\n2. **Use a Shared Expense App**: Apps like Splitwise, Tricount, or Splittr allow you to track expenses in real-time and calculate who owes what at the end of the trip. They're especially useful for managing shared costs like gas, accommodation, and group meals.\n\n3. **Assign a Trip Treasurer**: Pick one person (the most organized and finance-savvy) to be in charge of collecting receipts and keeping track of expenditures. This person can also remind others of pending payments.\n\n4. **Plan for Shared and Individual Costs**: Some expenses will be shared by everyone, like accommodation and car rental. Others, like personal souvenirs or individual meals/snacks, should be covered individually. Be clear about this distinction from the start.\n\n5. **Prepay When Possible**: For shared costs like accommodation or car rental, try to prepay as much as possible. This reduces the amount of money you need to exchange during the trip and simplifies the process.\n\n6. **Keep a Daily Expense Log**: Whether it's in an app or a notebook, write down all shared expenses as they happen. This avoids confusion and ensures that no expense is forgotten.\n\n7. **Settle Up Regularly**: If you're not prepaying, consider settling up at the end of each day or at a specific point during the trip. This prevents expenses from piling up and potentially becoming overwhelming.\n\n8. **Be Flexible and Understanding**: Despite all planning, sometimes unforeseen expenses can arise. Be prepared to adjust and discuss any issues as a group calmly and constructively.\n\n9. **Have a Contingency Fund**: If possible, everyone should chip in an equal amount to create a small contingency fund. This can cover unexpected expenses and can be divided back among everyone if not used.\n\n10. **Communicate**: The most important aspect is communication. Keep the lines open, and if anyone feels uncomfortable with how costs are being shared, encourage them to speak up so adjustments can be made.\n\nRemember, the goal of the trip is to have fun and create lasting memories with your friends. Managing finances well can ensure that money matters don't distract from the experience. Enjoy your planning and have a fantastic trip to San Diego!",
