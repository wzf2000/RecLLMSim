Here's a preliminary plan:\n\n**Accommodation:** A luxury resort in Miami that fits your description is the 1 Hotel South Beach. It's an upscale resort with a prime beachfront location, several pools, a high-end spa, and a well-equipped fitness center. They also have a rooftop bar and a few dining options on-site.\n\n**Transportation:** I suggest you rent a car from a reputable company like Enterprise or Hertz. They often have offices at the airport for easy pick-up and drop-off. For inner-city travel or nights out, using Uber or Lyft would be convenient.\n\nNow, let's move on to the itinerary.\n\n**Day 1-7:** Spend the first week acclimatizing to the city. Enjoy the resort amenities, explore the local area, and visit fitness centers like Anatomy at 1220 for group classes or personal training. For dining, try places like Joe's Stone Crab, Stubborn Seed, or The Capital Grille.\n\n**Day 8-14:** Attend networking events. The Miami Association of Realtors regularly hosts events that you might find interesting. Also, design showrooms like the Miami Design District offer events and showcases that could provide networking opportunities. \n\n**Day 15-21:** Continue attending networking events, but also take time to enjoy some of Miami's attractions. Visit the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, take an art deco tour in South Beach, or explore the vibrant neighborhoods of Wynwood and Little Havana.\n\n**Day 22-28:** For the last week, it might be a good idea to wind down and focus on relaxation and fitness. Spend more time at the resort's spa and fitness center, try some watersports, or take yoga classes at the beach.\n\n**Day 29-30:** Pack up and prepare for your departure. Make sure to return the rental car and confirm your airport transportation.\n\nRemember, this is a preliminary plan and can be adjusted based on your feedback or specific events happening during your stay. I'd recommend checking the event calendars of industry organizations closer to your travel date to align your itinerary with their schedules. \n\nDoes this plan sound appealing to you?
