A compact SUV might be a good fit. They're comfortable for long drives, have enough space for your luggage, and can handle a variety of road conditions. Companies like Hertz, Avis, or Budget have branches at Auckland Airport, and you can drop off the car in Queenstown. The price varies, but it's typically around $50-$70 per day. If you're comfortable with that price range, I'd recommend booking as soon as your flight details are confirmed to ensure availability.\n\n**Activities:**\n\nIn **Queenstown**:\n\n1. **Bungee Jumping:** AJ Hackett Bungy is the pioneer of bungee jumping in New Zealand and offers several jumps in Queenstown. The Nevis Bungy is the highest in New Zealand at 134m and costs around $275.\n   \n2. **Jet Boating:** The Shotover Jet is a popular choice. It's an exciting ride through the Shotover River Canyons and costs around $150. They operate multiple times a day, but it's recommended to book in advance during peak season.\n\nIn **Rotorua**:\n\n1. **Maori Cultural Experience:** The Tamaki Maori Village offers an immersive experience with traditional ceremonies, performances, and a Hangi feast. The evening experience costs around $130.\n\n2. **Mountain Biking:** The Redwoods-Whakarewarewa Forest is a top destination for mountain biking. You can rent a bike from Mountain Bike Rotorua for around $70 per day. They also offer guided tours if you prefer.\n\nPlease note, these prices are approximate and can vary. Once you decide on the activities, I'd recommend booking them as soon as possible to secure your spot. Let me know if you need any more information or assistance with booking these activities!",
