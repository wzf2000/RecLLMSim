First, let's look at the travel requirements for Canadians traveling to both Bali and Costa Rica:\n\n1. **Bali, Indonesia**\n   - Visa: Canadians are eligible for a visa exemption for a stay of up to 30 days. However, since you're planning a month-long trip, you'd need to apply for a visa on arrival, which is extendable for another 30 days.\n   - Flight: Direct flights are not available from Toronto to Bali. The quickest one-stop flight takes about 25 hours with airlines like Cathay Pacific or Korean Air.\n\n2. **Costa Rica**\n   - Visa: Canadians do not require a visa for stays up to 90 days.\n   - Flight: Direct flights from Toronto to San Jose, Costa Rica are available and typically take around 5-6 hours with airlines like Air Canada or WestJet.\n\nNow let's consider accommodation and wellness activities:\n\n**Bali**\n- Accommodation: Ubud, Bali's wellness hub, offers numerous eco-lodges and budget-friendly guesthouses. Examples include Bambu Indah and Swasti Eco Cottages, both of which prioritize sustainability and offer organic, vegan-friendly dining options.\n- Wellness Activities: Bali is known for its yoga and meditation retreats. There are numerous yoga studios like Yoga Barn and Radiantly Alive in Ubud. Bali also offers opportunities for nature walks, healing arts, and exploring local culture.\n\n**Costa Rica**\n- Accommodation: You'll find plenty of sustainable accommodation options in Costa Rica. For instance, the Luna Lodge in Osa Peninsula or Samasati Retreat in Puerto Viejo. Both offer wellness-focused amenities, immersion in nature, and locally sourced, plant-based food options.\n- Wellness Activities: Costa Rica offers yoga and meditation retreats, nature hikes, surfing, and wildlife tours. It's also known for thermal springs and volcanic mud baths, particularly in areas like La Fortuna.\n\nGiven the travel time, visa requirements, and your preferences, Costa Rica seems to be a more convenient option. However, both destinations offer unique wellness experiences. It ultimately depends on whether you prefer the spiritual and cultural richness of Bali or the biodiversity and 'Pura Vida' lifestyle of Costa Rica.\n\nOnce you decide on the destination, I can help you with a detailed itinerary, including wellness activities, sightseeing, transportation, and accommodation booking.",

I think flying from Toronto to San Jose and then taking a domestic flight to Puerto Jimenez sounds like the most efficient and least stressful way to begin my retreat. I'll look into booking flights that align with the domestic flight schedules to ensure a smooth connection. Staying overnight in San Jose might also be a good idea to break up the travel, so I'll explore those hotel options near the airport.\n\nI appreciate your guidance in creating a balanced and enriching itinerary for my stay at Luna Lodge. I'm looking forward to planning the weekly schedule that includes yoga, meditation, and the cultural and nature activities we discussed. I'll reach out to Luna Lodge to arrange the taxi from Puerto Jimenez and to inquire about any wellness programs or specific activities they offer that could be incorporated into my stay.\n\nOnce my flights and Luna Lodge accommodations are booked, I'll circle back to finalize the detailed itinerary and confirm any remaining logistics, like transportation for the local tours and activities.
