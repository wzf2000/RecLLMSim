Let's address your additional questions:\n\n1. **Car Rental**: Weather conditions in Banff during December can be quite snowy and icy. While the roads are usually well maintained, a larger vehicle like an SUV with good ground clearance and winter tires can handle these conditions better and provide extra safety. It would also offer more space for your luggage and any equipment you might rent.\n\n2. **Eateries & Groceries**: \n   - **Family-Friendly Restaurants**: Some popular options include The Grizzly House (known for its fondue), Park Distillery (offers a kids menu), and Bear Street Tavern (famous for its pizzas). For a quick bite, try BeaverTails for their namesake pastries.\n   - **Groceries**: You can shop at Banff's local grocery stores - Banff Springs Market or IGA. Both offer a variety of fresh produce, meats, dairy, bakery items, and more.\n\n3. **Ski/Snowboard Lessons**: Both Sunshine Village and Lake Louise Ski Resort offer ski and snowboard programs designed specifically for children. These include group lessons, private lessons, and multi-day camps. They provide a safe and fun learning environment for kids of all skill levels.\n\n4. **Dog Sledding**: No specific paperwork should be needed for the dog sledding tour. However, tours should be booked in advance as they can fill up quickly. It's essential to ensure that the tour company follows ethical practices regarding the treatment of dogs. Companies like Kingmik Dog Sled Tours or Snowy Owl Sled Dog Tours are known for their commitment to dog welfare.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to check in advance with any activities that you're booking, particularly those involving animals or outdoor adventures, to make sure there are no age restrictions or additional requirements that might apply to your family.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any more questions or need further assistance!",
