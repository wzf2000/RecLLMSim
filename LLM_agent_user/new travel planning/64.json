I'd be delighted to help you plan your trip to Xi'an. \n\nGiven your starting point in Beijing, there are various ways for you to get to Xi'an:\n\n1. **By Air:** It's about a 2 hour flight from Beijing to Xi'an. This is the quickest way but it might not be the most eco-friendly if that concerns you. Also, the flight delays might be common in China, which could affect your travel plans.\n\n2. **By Train:** The high-speed train is a popular option. The travel time is about 4.5 to 6 hours depending on the specific train you take. Beijing West Railway Station offers frequent high-speed train services to Xi'an North Railway Station. The advantage of the train is that it's more reliable time-wise compared to flights, and you'd also get to enjoy the landscape along the way.\n\n3. **By Bus or Car:** This isn't recommended due to the long distance (over 1100 km) which would take more than 10 hours of driving.\n\nConsidering your need for a cultural and historical tour, I would recommend taking the high-speed train from Beijing to Xi'an. It's comfortable, fairly quick, and you'll get to see some of the countryside along the way. Also, the train stations in both cities are well-connected to other parts of the city by public transportation.\n\nOnce you decide on your transportation method, we can move onto the next part of your trip planning.

As a landscape artist who enjoys painting, I'm seeking inspiration from my surroundings, so a place with beautiful views or gardens would be ideal.
