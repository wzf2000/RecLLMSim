The cost will be around $150 per night.\n- **Evening:** Relax and have dinner at the B&B or explore local restaurants that offer Southern cuisine.\n\n**Day 2: Bird Watching and Nature Walks**\n- **Morning:** Visit the Beaver Lake Bird Sanctuary, which offers excellent opportunities for bird watching. You might see species like the Blue Heron or various warblers.\n- **Afternoon:** Enjoy a leisurely walk at the Asheville Botanical Gardens and have a picnic with local foods from a nearby market.\n- **Evening:** Dine at a restaurant that serves traditional North Carolina BBQ, which is a must-try.\n\n**Day 3: Cultural Exploration and Departure**\n- **Morning:** Visit the historic Biltmore Estate, where you can enjoy both the architecture and the beautiful gardens.\n- **Afternoon:** Have lunch at the estate and then prepare for your departure back to Denver.\n\n### Budget Breakdown:\n- **Transportation:**\n  - Flight: ~$300 (round trip)\n  - Car rental: ~$100\n- **Accommodation:** $300 (2 nights)\n- **Meals and Miscellaneous:** $300\n\nThis plan keeps you comfortably within your budget of $1000, focusing on nature, relaxation, and local cuisine, as per your preferences.

It's a great place to start your day with your dog.\n- **Afternoon:** Explore the Santa Fe Plaza, the heart of the city, where you can visit local markets selling traditional crafts, foods, and more.
