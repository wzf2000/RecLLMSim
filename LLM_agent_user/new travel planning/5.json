Look for feedback on the cleanliness and maintenance of the vehicles, customer service, and overall satisfaction.\n\n7. **Rental Policies**: Review the rental policies for fuel, mileage, and drop-off times to avoid any unexpected fees.\n\nYou can typically book your rental car online through the company's website or a travel aggregator, which might help you compare prices and options in one place.
