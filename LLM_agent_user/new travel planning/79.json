Eco-Friendly Hotel Options\nI will identify hotels that are not just providing wellness amenities but are also recognized for their sustainability practices. These hotels often include energy-saving measures, water conservation practices, and initiatives to reduce waste, among other eco-friendly practices. I'll provide a selection for you to choose from, ensuring they fall within your budget range of $150-$200 per night.\n\n### 2. Day Trip to Mount Hua Details\nMount Hua (Huashan) is known for its breathtaking cliffs and is one of China's Five Great Mountains. The trip can involve a range of physical activities, including hiking and climbing stairs. There are cable cars available for those who prefer to avoid the more strenuous paths. For a fit individual, it's an exhilarating experience, but it's essential to wear appropriate footwear and carry water and snacks (your vegan packed meal will be arranged). I'll ensure you have all the details, including the physical demands, so you can fully prepare for this adventure.\n\n### 3. Vegan Restaurants Recommendations\n- **King's Joy**: Located near the Yonghegong Lama Temple, King's Joy is renowned for its gourmet vegan cuisine, with many organic options. The ambiance is serene, and the menu offers a creative take on vegan dishes.\n- **VegeTiger**: A gem in Xi'an for vegan travelers, offering a wide range of organic vegan dishes inspired by local flavors. It's a great spot to enjoy lunch or dinner, with a menu that clearly marks organic choices.\n\n### 4. Advance Booking and Visiting Hours\n- **Terracotta Army**: It's highly recommended to purchase tickets in advance, especially during the summer tourist season. The site usually opens from 8:30 AM to 5:30 PM, but these hours can change, so I'll ensure to check closer to your departure.\n- **Mount Hua**: For the cable cars and entrance tickets, booking ahead can save you time. The mountain is open year-round, but for hiking, it's best early in the day to make the most of your visit.\n- **Ancient City Wall**: No advance booking is required, but note the opening hours are usually from 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM for the main gates. Renting a bike on the wall can be a spontaneous decision once you're there.\n\nI will gather more detailed information on each of these points and ensure that your trip is well-organized, with sustainability, dietary needs, and personal preferences at the forefront. I'll also confirm the visa requirements for U.S. citizens traveling to China, ensuring you have all necessary documentation prepared well in advance of your trip.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else you'd like to add or modify in your itinerary.

Visa Requirements for U.S. Citizens Traveling to China**\nAs of my current knowledge, U.S. passport holders need a visa to enter China. You'll need to apply for a tourist visa (L Visa) prior to your departure. The process usually involves an application form, your actual passport, a passport-type photo, and a fee.
