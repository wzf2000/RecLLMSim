It's a peaceful city with beautiful natural scenery, known for its Pueblo-style architecture, vibrant art scene, and unique culinary offerings. It's also rich in history, with interesting museums and historical sites. The distance from Denver to Santa Fe is about 400 miles and can be comfortably covered by car in around 6 hours. A road trip would allow you to enjoy scenic views along the way.\n\nHere's a preliminary suggestion for your itinerary:\n\n**Day 1:**\n- Depart Denver early in the morning.\n- Arrive at Santa Fe in the afternoon, check into your hotel.\n- Explore the historic Santa Fe Plaza, visit Palace of the Governors and New Mexico Museum of Art.\n- Enjoy dinner at a local restaurant like Cafe Pasqual's to sample some traditional New Mexican cuisine.\n\n**Day 2:**\n- Visit the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in the morning.\n- Have lunch at The Shed, known for its New Mexican dishes and local bakery.\n- In the afternoon, take a light hike at the Dale Ball Trails, offering great views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.\n- Have dinner at a local restaurant.\n\n**Day 3:**\n- Explore the Museum of International Folk Art and Museum Hill in the morning.\n- Have lunch at a local bakery.\n- Visit Canyon Road, known for its art galleries.\n- Depart for Denver in the afternoon.\n\nAs for accommodations, the Inn of the Governors is a highly rated hotel that offers comfortable rooms and excellent service. It's also conveniently located near the Santa Fe Plaza.\n\nPlease let me know if this plan sounds interesting to you, or if you have any specific preferences or changes in mind.

This way, you'll have ample time for a leisurely drive back.\n\nFor the bakery on Day 3, I suggest visiting Clafoutis, which is a French bakery and restaurant known for its pastries, breads, and breakfast dishes. It's a local favorite and highly rated.\n\nNow, about the hotel, Inn of the Governors is located just two blocks from the Santa Fe Plaza. The rooms are designed in the Southwestern style and come with amenities like flat-screen TVs, free Wi-Fi, coffee makers, and mini-fridges. The hotel also offers complimentary tea and sherry in the lobby, free parking, an outdoor pool, and a restaurant and bar on-site. \n\nAs for the budget, here is a rough estimate:\n- Hotel: A 2-night stay at the Inn of the Governors would be around $200 per night, totaling $400.\n- Gas: The round trip from Denver to Santa Fe is about 800 miles. If your car gets 25 miles per gallon, you'll need about 32 gallons of gas. Assuming gas costs $3 per gallon, this would total approximately $96.\n- Meals: Estimating $30 per meal and three meals per day, food could cost around $180 for three days.\n- Attractions: Most museums in Santa Fe are around $15 for admission, so if you visit four museums, that would be around $60.\n- Miscellaneous: It's always good to set aside some money for extra expenses, souvenirs, or unexpected costs. Let's set aside $150 for this.\n\nAdding these up, the total cost of the trip would be approximately $886. \n\nPlease note that these are rough estimates and actual prices can vary. Also, the hotel price doesn't take into account any potential discounts or deals available at the time of booking. I recommend booking in advance to secure the best rates.
