Here's a recommendation for your stay and some cultural and philanthropic activities:\n\n**Accommodation**\n\n- **Hotel Martinez**: One of the most iconic hotels on the French Riviera, Hotel Martinez offers the quintessential Cannes experience. It is part of The Unbound Collection by Hyatt and is known for its Art Deco style, luxury rooms with stunning sea views, and a private beach. The hotel's La Palme d'Or, a two-Michelin-starred restaurant, offers a unique gastronomic experience. Additionally, the L.Raphael Spa in the hotel is perfect for unwinding after a day of golf or cultural excursions.\n\n**Cultural Events**\n\n- **Cannes Film Festival**: If your trip coincides with the Cannes Film Festival, usually held in May, it's an unparalleled cultural event showcasing international cinema. Although it's an industry event, there are often parallel activities open to the public.\n\n- **Les Plages Electroniques**: This is one of the largest electronic music festivals in France and takes place on Cannes' beaches in August. It offers a different cultural vibe but is worth checking out if you're interested in modern music scenes.\n\n- **Museum visits**: The Musée de la Castre offers a collection of Mediterranean antiquities, pre-Columbian primitive art, and 19th-century Provencal landscape paintings, all housed in a medieval castle.\n\n**Philanthropy**\n\n- **Les Restos du Cœur**: This is a French charity that distributes food packages and hot meals to the needy. While their work isn't strictly focused on education or women's rights, they often have local branches and could be a point of contact for community work or donations.\n\n- **Solidarité Femmes**: This organization is dedicated to helping women victims of violence. They may have local initiatives or events in Cannes that you could support or get involved with.\n\n- **Amnesty International France**: Occasionally, they host events and education campaigns that you may be interested in. They focus on human rights, including women's rights, and education on these issues.\n\nTo engage in local philanthropy, it's often best to reach out to these organizations in advance to see how you can contribute or participate during your stay.\n\nWould you like me to assist you with booking the hotel or contacting any of these organizations? Additionally, I can help you plan a detailed daily itinerary, including dining, leisure, and sightseeing, for your trip to Cannes.",
