Here's a tentative plan for your weekend getaway:\n\n**Day 1: Arrival and Wine Tasting**\n- Morning: Depart from New York City. The flight is about 6 hours direct.\n- Afternoon: Check into your hotel. I recommend Bardessono Hotel and Spa, which is known for its luxury amenities and excellent location. It's within walking distance of Yountville's top restaurants and has a fantastic spa which offers vineyard-themed treatments.\n- Evening: Enjoy a wine tasting at one of the nearby vineyards. Robert Mondavi Winery is a classic choice with a great selection of wines.\n\n**Day 2: Winery Tour and Hot Air Balloon Ride**\n- Morning: Start your day with a hot air balloon ride over Napa Valley. Balloons Above the Valley offers a package that includes a pre-flight café & pastry service, approximately 1 hour balloon flight, and a post-flight champagne brunch.\n- Afternoon: Visit the Castello di Amorosa for a winery tour. It's a 13th-century-inspired Tuscan castle and winery that offers a variety of tour and tasting options.\n- Evening: Dine at The French Laundry, a three-star Michelin restaurant. It's pricey but worth it for the exceptional food and service.\n\n**Day 3: Shopping and Departure**\n- Morning: Visit the V Marketplace for shopping. It's a historic, 140-year-old winery converted into a retail complex with a variety of boutiques and a gourmet grocery shop.\n- Afternoon: Have a leisurely lunch at Bouchon, another excellent restaurant in Yountville, then head back to the hotel to check out and get ready for your flight back to New York.\n\nHow does this itinerary sound?

The average high is around 59°F (15°C) and the average low is about 39°F (4°C). There can be some rain, so I'd recommend packing warm clothes and a waterproof jacket.\n\n2. **Estimated Cost:** Here's a rough breakdown -\n   - Round-trip flights from NYC to San Francisco: $300-$500 per person\n   - Car rental for the weekend: $100-$200\n   - Hotel: Bardessono Hotel and Spa is around $600-$800 per night, so for two nights that would be $1200-$1600\n   - Activities: Wine tasting and winery tours vary, but budget around $50-$100 per person for each winery. The hot air balloon ride with Balloons Above the Valley is $209 per person.\n   - Dining: A meal at The French Laundry can be around $350-$450 per person, not including wine. \n   \n   So the total estimated cost would be around $2,500 - $3,500. This is on the lower end of your budget, leaving some room for shopping, additional meals, and any other expenses.\n\n3. **COVID-19 Regulations:** As of now, California doesn't have any travel restrictions in place for domestic visitors, but it's always a good idea to check the official California state website for the most up-to-date information. Most businesses, including wineries and restaurants, are operating with safety measures in place. These typically include mask requirements, social distancing, and capacity limits. It's also recommended to make reservations for winery visits and dining, as walk-ins may not always be accommodated due to these restrictions.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like to proceed with bookings.",
