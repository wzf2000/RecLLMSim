Here's a preliminary plan for your trip:\n\n**Transportation**:\nSince you're traveling from Beijing, the most convenient way to reach Xi'an is by high-speed train, which takes around 4.5 to 6 hours.

This park is a large cultural theme park that presents the culture of the Tang Dynasty, known for its tranquility and beauty, which might inspire your creativity. Alternatively, you could visit the Xi'an Botanical Garden, which offers a serene environment away from the city's hustle.\n\n**Day 6 - Local Music Scene**:\nSince we're replacing the Mount Huashan trip, let's dive deeper into Xi'an's local music scene. The Shaanxi Grand Opera House Xi'an is known for showcasing traditional Chinese music and theater performances. It would be worth checking their schedule closer to your visit. Another option is the Xi'an Concert Hall, where you might catch classical music performances. For a more contemporary scene, consider visiting some local bars and cafes in the Defu Lane area, where live music performances are common.\n\n**Vegan-Friendly Food Recommendations**:\n\n1. **Biang Biang Noodles**: While traditionally not vegan, many places can prepare them without meat. These wide, belt-like noodles are a must-try Xi'an specialty.\n   \n2. **Rou Jia Mo**: Also known as the Chinese hamburger, this can be found in vegan versions in some spots in the Muslim Quarter.\n   \n3. **Liángpí**: This is a cold noodle dish that's naturally vegan, made from wheat or rice flour and served with vinegar, garlic, and chili oil.\n\n4. **Restaurants**:\n   - **King Town**: Offers various vegan options and is known for its pleasant ambiance.\n   - **Vege Tiger**: A vegan restaurant with a variety of dishes, including some Western options.\n   - **Suji Restaurant**: Not entirely vegan but has a range of vegan options; it's known for its traditional setting and creative dishes.\n\nThese dishes and restaurants should give you a taste of the local cuisine while adhering to your dietary preferences.\n\nLet me know if there are more adjustments you'd like or any other specifics you're interested in!",

Xi'an is a wonderful city with so much to offer, and I'm sure you'll have an incredible time exploring its history, culture, and culinary delights.\n\n**Transportation Within Xi'an:**\n\nXi'an has a highly efficient and convenient public transportation system that makes getting around the city quite easy.\n\n1. **Subway**: Xi'an's subway system is rapidly expanding and currently has several operational lines that connect major tourist spots, including the Xi'an Railway Station, the Big Wild Goose Pagoda, and the Muslim Quarter. It's clean, fast, and affordable. Make sure to check the latest subway map or use a navigation app for the most current routes and schedules.\n\n2. **Buses**: The city has an extensive network of buses that reach every corner of Xi'an. They are incredibly cheap but can be a bit more challenging for non-Mandarin speakers. Google Maps or Baidu Maps can help plan your bus journeys. Special tourist buses (marked with a \"游\") are designed to connect major attractions and might be more convenient for your needs.\n\n3. **Bicycles**: Xi'an is quite bike-friendly, with many areas around the city wall and within the city center offering bike rental services. Apps like Mobike or Ofo allow you to rent a bike for a small fee, providing a great way to explore the city at your own pace, especially the areas around the Ancient City Wall.\n\n4. **Taxis and Ride-Sharing**: Taxis are plentiful and reasonably priced. Didi Chuxing, the Chinese equivalent of Uber, is widely used in Xi'an and offers a convenient way to get around, especially if you're not familiar with the public transport system or if you're traveling late at night. It's recommended to have the address of your destination in Chinese, as not all drivers may speak English.\n\n5. **Walking**: Lastly, don't underestimate the joy of exploring Xi'an on foot, especially within areas like the Muslim Quarter, around the Big Wild Goose Pagoda, and other historic sites. Walking allows you to take in the sights, sounds, and smells of the city at a leisurely pace.\n\nRemember, during peak tourist seasons, public transport can get crowded, and attractions may be busier than usual, so plan your day with some flexibility.\n\nI'm here to help if you have any more questions or need further assistance with your travel plans.
