Trains and buses are good options for longer distances, like Lisbon to Porto.\n- **Dining**: Explore local markets and seafood restaurants. Portugal is known for its fresh, local cuisine.\n- **Language**: English is widely spoken in tourist areas, but learning a few phrases in Portuguese can enhance your experience.\n\nLet's refine this plan further.

Could you provide a bit more information about yoga retreat options? Also, my child is a bit scared of boat rides.

It's a fantastic place to explore local produce and taste a variety of dishes from different chefs all under one roof.\n\n2. **Week 2 in The Algarve**: There are several yoga retreats in the Algarve. One of them is \"Vale de Moses,\" a highly-rated yoga retreat nestled in the heart of the Portuguese mountains. As for the Benagil Caves, while boat tours are the most common way to visit, you can also visit the cave by stand-up paddleboarding or kayaking, which might be a more gentle option. \n\n3. **Week 3 in Porto and the Douro Valley**: Great! We'll keep this week as is.\n\n4. **Week 4 in Madeira or the Azores**: Both islands are family-friendly, but Madeira might be a better fit for your needs. It's slightly easier to get to, has a wider range of kid-friendly activities, and its climate is a bit more predictable. \n\n5. **Transportation**: Parking in Lisbon and Porto can be challenging in the city centers due to narrow streets and limited parking. Many hotels offer parking, but it can be pricey. You might want to consider returning your rental car once you're back in the cities and use public transportation, taxis, or walking to get around.\n\nFor networking in Lisbon, I'd recommend checking out the Lisbon Digital Nomads meetup. They organize weekly meetups in different formats, including co-working sessions and social gatherings. The Impact Hub Lisbon is another good place for networking events and meeting other entrepreneurs. StartUP Lisboa is an incubation center that hosts a variety of events and could offer opportunities to connect with other business owners.\n\nLet me know if these adjustments work for you, or if there's anything else you would like to know or change!",
