You have a few options to get from Shanghai to Xi'an:\n\n1. **Flight**: This is the fastest option.

The journey takes around 6 to 7 hours.\n\n3. **Overnight train**: This option could save you a night's accommodation, but it will take about 15 hours.\n\nAs for accommodation, I recommend staying within the city walls of Xi'an. This area is close to many historical sites such as the Bell Tower, Drum Tower, and Muslim Quarter. Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Sofitel Legend People's Grand Hotel Xi'an**: This is a luxury hotel located within the ancient city walls, offering easy access to major historical sites.\n\n2. **Grand Mercure Xi'an on Renmin Square**: This is a mid-range option, also located within the city walls.\n\n3. **Xi'an Travelling With Hostel (South Gate)**: If you're on a budget, this hostel has a great reputation and is also within the city walls.\n\nBefore we detail your itinerary, do you have a preference for transportation?

You might also enjoy a bike ride on the wall, which is open until 8:00 PM.\n\n**Day 2**: Dedicate this day to the Terracotta Army. The site opens at 8:30 AM and closes at 5:30 PM. It's about an hour's drive from the city, so consider getting an early start. \n\n**Day 3**: Spend the morning exploring the Ancient City Wall if you didn't have enough time on Day 1. Later, head to the Muslim Quarter to enjoy the famous food street and local markets. The area is lively well into the evening.\n\nRemember to factor in potential jet lag and pace yourself to avoid exhaustion.
