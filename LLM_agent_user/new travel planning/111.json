Based on your preferences, here are two destination options that could offer the serene and cultural experience you desire, along with mild climates in December, without the need for a visa for U.S. citizens:\n\n**Option 1: Charleston, South Carolina**\n- **Why Charleston**: Known for its rich history, well-preserved architecture, and excellent restaurants, Charleston offers a blend of culture and relaxation. The December weather is mild, and there are numerous gardens, plantations, and beaches nearby.\n- **Accommodation**: Consider renting a historic home through a vacation rental service to immerse yourselves in the city's charm, or stay at a boutique guesthouse in the historic district.\n- **Activities**: Explore the cobblestone streets, take a carriage ride, visit Fort Sumter National Monument, and enjoy light hikes in the nearby Angel Oak Park. A day trip to the serene beaches on Sullivan's Island could also be rejuvenating. Don't miss the local spas for that relaxing retreat.\n- **Transportation**: Fly from Chicago to Charleston. Rent a car for local excursions or use ride-sharing services for in-town transportation.\n\n**Option 2: Sedona, Arizona**\n- **Why Sedona**: Sedona's red rock scenery is truly calming and its mild climate in December is perfect for outdoor activities. It's also known for its wellness and spa retreats.\n- **Accommodation**: Look for a vacation rental with views of the red rocks, or select a boutique guesthouse or inn that offers privacy and comfort.\n- **Activities**: Enjoy light trails like the Bell Rock Pathway or Cathedral Rock Trail, visit the Chapel of the Holy Cross, and explore the Tlaquepaque Arts & Shopping Village. Indulge in a spa day at one of Sedona's many wellness resorts.\n- **Transportation**: Fly from Chicago to Phoenix, then rent a car for the scenic two-hour drive to Sedona. Having a car will be useful for exploring the various sites around the area.\n\nTo keep within your budget, I'd recommend booking flights and accommodations in advance to secure the best prices. For each location, here's a sample 5-day itinerary that you can adjust based on your two-week stay:\n\n**Charleston 5-Day Sample Itinerary**:\nDay 1: Arrival and settle into accommodation.

These services allow you to compare prices across different airlines.\n\n**Accommodation**: Websites like Airbnb, Vrbo, or Booking.com offer a wide range of vacation rentals.

Daytime temperatures often range from the mid 50s to low 60s degrees Fahrenheit (around 10-15 degrees Celsius), while nighttime can drop to around freezing. There is a chance of rain, and occasionally snow, though it's typically not heavy. \n\nI would recommend packing layers to accommodate the range in temperatures. Include a light winter jacket, sweaters, long sleeve shirts, and comfortable pants. For your hiking days, consider moisture-wicking clothing and supportive footwear. Don't forget to pack hats and sunblock to protect from the sun, which can be intense due to Sedona's elevation.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
