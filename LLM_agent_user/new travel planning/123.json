Here's a preliminary plan for your one-week trip to Xi'an:\n\n**Day 1 - Arrival & Settling In**\nUpon landing at Xi'an Xianyang International Airport, you can take a taxi or arrange for a private transfer to your hotel. I recommend the \"Eastern House Boutique Hotel\" - it's a beautiful hotel that perfectly combines traditional Chinese elements with modern comfort, and it's conveniently located near the city center.\n\nAfter you've settled into your hotel, spend the rest of the day exploring your surroundings and overcoming any jet lag. Have a nice dinner at a nearby restaurant. \"De Fa Chang Restaurant\" is a good option where you can try famous Xi'an dumplings.\n\n**Day 2 - Terracotta Army & Banpo Museum**\nStart your day early with a visit to the Terracotta Army. It's a bit outside of the city, so taking a taxi or hiring a driver would be ideal. Spend the morning exploring the fascinating history of China's first emperor. \n\nIn the afternoon, head to the Banpo Museum, an archaeological site of a neolithic matriarchal community. Enjoy dinner back in the city at \"First Noodle Under The Sun\", which is highly praised for its traditional Xi'an noodles.\n\n**Day 3 - Ancient City Wall & Muslim Quarter**\nSpend the morning cycling or walking on the Ancient City Wall. After lunch, spend your afternoon exploring the bustling Muslim Quarter, known for its abundant food stalls, souvenir shops, and traditional mosques. Try some local street food like \"Roujiamo\" (Chinese hamburger) and \"Liángpí\" (cold skin noodles).\n\n**Day 4 - Cultural Show & Workshop**\nAttend a traditional Chinese cultural show, such as the \"Tang Dynasty Show\", which includes a performance and traditional Chinese dinner. In the afternoon, participate in a Chinese calligraphy or terracotta warrior-making workshop.\n\n**Day 5 - Shaanxi History Museum & Big Wild Goose Pagoda**\nVisit the Shaanxi History Museum in the morning to learn more about the province's history. After lunch, head to the Big Wild Goose Pagoda, a Buddhist pagoda built during the Tang Dynasty.\n\n**Day 6 - Day Trip to Mount Huashan**\nConsider taking a day trip to Mount Huashan, one of China's Five Great Mountains, known for its breathtaking views and precipitous cliffs. This will be a full-day trip, so prepare accordingly.\n\n**Day 7 - Leisure Day & Departure**\nTake the day to relax, shop for souvenirs, or explore any areas you may have missed. When you're ready, take a taxi or private transfer back to the airport for your departure.\n\nPlease note that this is a tentative plan and can be adjusted based on your preferences and the actual situation on the ground.
