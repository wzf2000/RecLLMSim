Despite this, there's still plenty of sunshine.\n\nHere are some packing suggestions:\n\n1. **Lightweight and breathable clothing**: Given the humid and warm condition, light fabrics like cotton or linen are good choices.\n\n2. **Rain gear**: A light, packable raincoat or poncho and waterproof bag for your electronics might come in handy.\n\n3. **Footwear**: Pack comfortable sandals for general wear, and waterproof shoes if you plan on hiking.\n\n4. **Swimwear and Sunscreen**: Despite the rain, you'll still have opportunities to swim, whether at the beach or your hotel's pool. Bali is near the equator, so the sun can be strong. Protect your skin with a good, eco-friendly sunscreen.\n\n5. **Yoga and workout clothes**: If you plan to participate in yoga or fitness activities, pack appropriate gear.\n\n6. **Modest clothing for temples**: If you plan to visit temples, pack a sarong and a scarf to cover your shoulders. Some temples provide these at the entrance, but it's always a good idea to bring your own.\n\nRemember, the weather can be unpredictable, so it's best to be prepared for a bit of everything.
