Given the distance between New York City and Xi'an, direct flights are not available. You will need to consider a one-stop flight, with layovers in cities like Beijing, Shanghai or Guangzhou.\n\nAirlines that operate this route include Air China, China Eastern, and China Southern. The flight duration typically ranges from 18 to 20 hours, including the layover. For your comfort, I would recommend choosing an airline that offers spacious seating and good in-flight service. \n\nAs for the cost, the price of a round-trip ticket to Xi'an from New York in the summer can range from $800 to $1300, depending on when you book and the specific flight you choose. I would advise booking as early as possible to secure the best price.\n\nBefore we go further, I also want to check: Do you already have a Chinese visa or will you need information on how to apply for one?",

Here are the steps to apply for a Chinese tourist visa, also known as an L visa:\n\n1. Fill out the China Tourist Visa Application Form: You can either download it from the Chinese embassy's website or fill it out online.\n\n2. Prepare the following documents: \n   - Your valid passport, with at least 6 months' validity and blank visa pages.\n   - Photocopy of the passport's data page.\n   - One recent passport-quality photo.\n   - Proof of travel, such as flight ticket reservation and proof of hotel reservation, or an invitation letter from a Chinese citizen or a foreigner with a Chinese permanent residence permit.\n\n3. Submit the application: You can either submit your application directly to the Chinese embassy or consulate, or use an approved agency if you cannot do it in person. The application process usually takes 4 to 5 business days, but expedited services are available for an additional fee.\n\nNow, onto the flights. I recommend using flight search engines like Skyscanner or Google Flights to find the best deals. Currently, for a departure in mid-July and a return in late July, the cheapest one-stop flights are offered by Air China and China Eastern, with prices ranging from $800 to $900. Layovers are in Beijing or Shanghai, and the total travel time is approximately 20 hours each way. \n\nRemember that prices fluctuate frequently, so it's a good idea to set up a price alert on these platforms to get notified when prices drop. \n\nPlease let me know if you need assistance with hotel booking, itinerary planning in Xi'an, or any other part of your trip!",

It's not only close to the city's main attractions but also surrounded by lush gardens that provide a serene escape from the bustling city. The hotel hosts several restaurants that offer a range of international and local cuisines, including a highly praised Cantonese restaurant. Given your culinary interests, the variety and quality of food here would likely be a highlight. The Sofitel is known for its spacious rooms, excellent service, and amenities like a spa, indoor pool, and fitness center. Prices are reasonable for the level of luxury provided.\n\n2. **Wyndham Grand Xian South**: This hotel is celebrated for its beautiful architecture, inspired by the Tang Dynasty, and its proximity to the Big Wild Goose Pagoda as well as other historical sites. It's a bit closer to the Terracotta Army than the city center, offering a nice balance for your itinerary. The Wyndham Grand boasts multiple dining options, including a superb buffet that features both international and Shaanxi local dishes, allowing you to indulge in the local cuisine right at your hotel. The rooms are modern, spacious, and well-equipped, ensuring a comfortable stay. With its excellent service and amenities like a fitness center and indoor pool, it offers great value for a luxurious experience.\n\nBoth options provide the comfort and luxury you're looking for, with excellent access to local cuisine and major attractions. The Sofitel Xian on Renmin Square is more centrally located, making it ideal if you prefer to be in the heart of Xi'an. The Wyndham Grand Xian South, on the other hand, might offer a quieter stay with slightly easier access to the Terracotta Army.\n\nDue to the popularity of these hotels, especially in the summer, I recommend booking as soon as your travel dates are confirmed to secure a good rate. Would you like more information on either of these hotels, or assistance with booking?",

You can walk, cycle, or even take an electric cart around the wall. The wall opens at 8:00 AM and closes at 10:00 PM.\n\n- For lunch, try the \"Biang Biang Noodles\", one of the \"ten strange wonders of Shaanxi\", at a local restaurant.\n\n- In the afternoon, visit the **Shaanxi History Museum** to further immerse yourself in Xi'an's rich history. The museum closes at 5:30 PM.\n\n- In the evening, stroll around the Grand Tang Mall for shopping and dining.\n\n**Day 3:** \n\n- Dedicate your day to the **Muslim Quarter**. Start in the morning to avoid the crowd and explore the Great Mosque first, then delve into the food street. You'll find a variety of snacks and local dishes, such as \"Rou Jia Mo\" (Chinese hamburger), \"Lamb Skewers\", and \"Sticky Rice in a Jar\".\n\n- In the afternoon, visit the **Drum and Bell Towers**, which are not far from the Muslim Quarter.\n\n- Wrap up your final evening with dinner at one of the high-end restaurants in your hotel, or try another local restaurant if you prefer.\n\nRemember to adjust the itinerary as needed based on your pace and preferences.
