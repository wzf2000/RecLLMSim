The total travel time is usually around 20-23 hours. \n\nAs for visas, US citizens can visit Indonesia without a visa for up to 30 days for tourism purposes.

This is within your budget and allows you some extra for personal expenses, souvenirs, and possibly a few outside trips.\n\nFor flights, the best option would be to choose an airline with a commitment to sustainability. While direct flights from San Francisco to Bali are not common, airlines like Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines offer one-stop flights and have eco-friendly policies in place such as newer, fuel-efficient aircraft and carbon offset programs. The flight costs will vary, but you can expect it to be around $900-$1300 for a round trip.\n\nUpon reaching Ubud, attractions in line with your interests include the Ubud Monkey Forest, Tegallalang Rice Terraces, and the Campuhan Ridge Walk. These offer plenty of opportunities for quiet reading, meditation, and peaceful walks amidst nature.\n\nAs for health and safety, Fivelements Retreat is committed to ensuring the safety of its guests amidst the ongoing pandemic. They have increased sanitation measures, provide personal protective equipment for staff, and encourage social distancing. However, I would advise contacting them directly for the most current and detailed information.\n\nOnce you've confirmed your interest, I can help you with the booking process.",

Their dishes are not only vegan but also artistically presented, making dining here a unique experience.\n   \n2. **The Seeds of Life**: This cafe serves raw vegan food that is both nutritious and delicious. It's a great spot for breakfast or lunch, with a cozy atmosphere.\n   \n3. **Moksa Plant-based Cuisine & Permaculture Garden**: A bit outside the town center, Moksa offers an exceptional farm-to-table experience. The serene setting is perfect for those looking for peace while dining.\n\n4. **Alchemy**: The first 100% raw vegan cafe in Bali, offering a salad bar, smoothies, and raw chocolates. It's a perfect place for a healthy snack or meal.\n\n### Local Transportation:\n\nUbud is somewhat walkable, but for longer distances, you might consider other modes of transportation. Eco-friendly options include:\n\n- **Bicycle Rentals**: Many places in Ubud rent bicycles. It’s a great way to explore the town and its surroundings at your own pace while keeping your carbon footprint low.\n\n- **Electric Scooters**: Some rental services offer electric scooters, which are an eco-friendly way to get around.\n\n- **Shuttle Services**: Your retreat and some restaurants offer shuttle services. It's worth asking in advance.\n\n- **Private Driver**: For exploring further afield, hiring a private driver for the day can be relatively inexpensive. While not the most eco-friendly option, sharing the ride with other guests can reduce the impact.\n\n### Adjusted Plan:\n\n- **Day 1**: Arrive in Bali and check into a hotel near the retreat for your acclimatization day. Relax and explore the surroundings at a leisurely pace.\n\n- **Day 2**: Check-in at Fivelements Retreat.\n\n- **Day 3-14**: Follow the retreat's scheduled activities. On days you wish to explore, you can visit the suggested attractions and dine at the vegan restaurants mentioned.\n\n- **Day 15**: Departure from Bali.\n\nRegarding the flight, aiming for an arrival in Bali in the morning or early afternoon would give you the rest of the day to rest. When booking, look for flights that align with this preference to maximize your rest time on arrival.\n\nLet me know if you need assistance with booking flights or the retreat, or if there's anything else you'd like to add to your plan!",
