For international flights, you might also consider Air France for a direct flight to Paris.\n- The best time to book flights varies, but generally, booking 2-3 months in advance can help you find the best deals. Keep an eye on fare tracking websites like Skyscanner or Google Flights to monitor price trends. \n\n**Car Rental:**\n- Given that your trip will involve both city driving and rural exploration, I recommend a compact SUV. This type of vehicle provides enough space for your family and luggage, handles well in various driving conditions, and is still manageable in city traffic. \n\n**Military History Sites:**\n- For some sites like the Normandy American Cemetery, guided tours don't need to be booked in advance. However, for a more immersive experience at places like Fort Douaumont or the Bastogne War Museum, it's wise to book a tour in advance, especially during the summer tourist season. \n\n**Camping Gear:**\n- In the Ardennes, summer temperatures range from 50°F (10°C) to 70°F (20°C), and rain is not uncommon. Therefore, your camping gear should include waterproof tents, comfortable sleeping bags, warm clothing, cooking equipment, and a first-aid kit. \n- You should be able to rent camping gear locally if needed. For example, Camping Petite Suisse offers tent rental services. However, it's always a good idea to bring essential items from home to ensure availability and fit with your family's needs.\n\nI hope this helps.
