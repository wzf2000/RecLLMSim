It's the oldest State Park in California, about a 1.5 hour drive from San Jose, and offers splendid views of ancient redwoods, waterfalls, and diverse wildlife. Plus, it has well-established campgrounds.\n\nHere's a suggested plan:\n\n**Day 1:**\n- Morning: Depart from San Jose, arriving at Big Basin by late morning. Check into your campground.\n- Afternoon: Set up your camp and have lunch. You can bring packed vegetarian food from San Jose or buy from the park's store.\n- Evening: Explore the Redwood Loop Trail, a short but beautiful trail showcasing some of the park's largest trees.\n\n**Day 2:**\n- Morning and Afternoon: Take on the Skyline to the Sea Trail - it's a long one, so take a packed lunch. You'll see waterfalls, wildlife, and amazing views of the forest.\n- Evening: Return to camp. Rest and relax.\n\n**Day 3:**\n- Morning: Pack up camp and check out. If time allows, visit the park's nature museum before leaving.\n- Afternoon: Return to San Jose.\n\nAs for costs:\n- The entrance fee for the park is $10.\n- Camping can range from $35 to $50 per night depending on the site.\n\nYou can keep the food costs low by packing meals from home. Remember to pack enough water and snacks for your hikes.\n\nDoes this plan sound good to you? Let me know if you'd like any changes.",

Carry a whistle for attracting attention in case of an emergency. Bring a first-aid kit and familiarize yourself with basic first aid procedures. Although cell service is limited, it's still advisable to keep your phone fully charged and switched off or on airplane mode when not in use to conserve battery.\n\n2. **Hiking Gear:** Apart from supportive footwear, it's recommended to carry a map of the trail, a compass, a rain jacket (weather can be unpredictable), a hat, sunblock, a headlamp or flashlight with extra batteries, and a multi-tool or knife. Given the length of the trail, you might want to consider hiking poles for support.\n\n3. **Vegetarian-Friendly Snacks and Meals:** \n    - Snacks: Trail mix, energy bars, dried fruits, and nuts are lightweight and nutritious options.\n    - Meals: Consider ready-to-eat meals like canned beans, vegetarian jerky, cheese, and crackers. For hot meals, you could bring along instant soup or noodle packets - just remember to pack a small stove and pot.\n    - Breakfast: Instant oatmeal packets are easy to carry and prepare.
