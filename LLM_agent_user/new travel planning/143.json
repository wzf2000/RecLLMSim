They can come with a king bed or two double beds, and typically range from $800-$900 per night.\n\nThe resort offers various fitness and wellness activities. You can join in on group fitness classes, personal training sessions, or even tennis lessons. They also have a spa and a salon.\n\nI checked the availability, and it seems that there are still rooms available for weekends in December. However, at this popular time of year, they are booking up quickly.\n\nRegarding flights, I found some options for you:\n\n1. **JetBlue**: They offer a direct flight from JFK to Palm Beach International. The flight duration is around 3 hours. Prices for a round trip in December are currently around $250-$300.\n\n2. **Delta**: They also offer a direct flight from JFK to Palm Beach International. The flight duration and prices are quite similar to JetBlue.\n\nAs for the daily itinerary, here are some suggestions:\n\n- **Day 1**: Arrive at the resort, settle in, and take a leisurely walk on the beach. Enjoy dinner at Echo, the resort's Asian restaurant.\n- **Day 2**: Start your day with a fitness class, followed by a healthy breakfast. Spend the rest of your morning lounging by the pool or at the beach. In the afternoon, you might enjoy a spa treatment. Enjoy dinner at either The Seafood Bar or The Italian Restaurant.\n- **Day 3**: Enjoy another fitness class in the morning. Spend your day exploring the resort, enjoying the beach, or relaxing by the pool. You may wish to indulge in another spa treatment or explore the shops at the resort.
