It's known for its vineyards and wineries, beautiful natural scenery, and delicious local food, making it a perfect destination for a relaxing and fun-filled weekend.\n\nHere is a rough plan:\n\n**Day 1:**\n\n- Depart New York City in the morning by car or bus. The journey takes around 4-5 hours.\n\n- Check into a luxury hotel or a cozy bed and breakfast by the lake. Some high-end options include Geneva On The Lake or The Lake House on Canandaigua.\n\n- After settling in, start your gourmet exploration at one of the local wineries. Many of them offer wine tasting tours. For instance, Dr. Konstantin Frank Winery, which is one of the most prestigious in the area.\n\n**Day 2:**\n\n- Spend the day exploring more vineyards. There are also local breweries and distilleries if you're interested.\n\n- In the afternoon, take a relaxing cruise on one of the lakes or visit Watkins Glen State Park if you enjoy walking in nature.\n\n- For dinner, enjoy a farm-to-table dining experience at one of the local restaurants.\n\n**Day 3:**\n\n- Before heading back to New York City, you could visit the Corning Museum of Glass or the Rockwell Museum.\n\n- Return to NYC in the afternoon.\n\nPlease let me know if this plan sounds good to you, or if there's anything else you'd like to add or change.",

Since you'll be driving, you can simply use a GPS for directions.\n\n**Scenic Route**\nFor a more scenic journey from NYC to Finger Lakes, I recommend taking the slightly longer route along the Taconic State Parkway. This route takes you through the scenic Hudson Valley. You can then continue onto NY-17 W and I-86 W to reach the Finger Lakes region. The journey may take up to 6 hours, but the beautiful landscape of rolling hills, charming towns, and picturesque farms certainly makes up for it.\n\nRemember to check the road conditions and weather forecast before the trip, especially since it's in December.
