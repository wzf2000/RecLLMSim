Ensure you check for any package deals that might include spa treatments or dining credits.\n\n### Arranging Transportation:\n- **Airport to Resort:** Check if Nizuc Resort offers shuttle services from the airport.

Buying tickets in advance can often save you money and time.\n\n### Booking a Spa Treatment:\n- **Spa Day:** Contact the resort's spa directly via their website or phone. They can provide you with the available treatments and help you schedule your appointment for Day 2 in the afternoon.\n\n### Making Dinner Reservations:\n- **Sushi Restaurant:** For a top-rated sushi experience, consider dining at Tora Cancún or Rosanegra. Visit their websites or call them to make a reservation for Day 3.
