Italian cuisine is always a delight, and the wine regions of Lombardy are just a short drive away.\n\n3. **Napa Valley, California**: If you'd prefer to stay in the US, Napa Valley could be a great choice. It's one of the world's premier wine regions and boasts a number of gourmet restaurants. The area also has boutique and high-end shops.\n\n4. **Tokyo, Japan**: Tokyo is a fashion-forward city with a unique style.

Let's get started with your travel arrangements and accommodations.\n\n**Flights from New York to Paris:**\nYou'll likely be flying from either John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) or Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) to Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) in Paris. Business class tickets will provide you with comfort and luxury for the transatlantic flight. I recommend booking your flight as soon as possible to get the best rates and seat availability. Airlines such as Air France, Delta, or American Airlines typically offer direct business class flights to Paris.\n\n**Accommodations in Paris:**\nFor a luxurious stay in a central location, consider the following hotels:\n\n1. **The Ritz Paris**: This iconic hotel is situated in the heart of Paris, close to the Place Vendôme and the Palais Garnier opera house. It's the epitome of Parisian luxury.\n\n2. **Le Meurice**: This opulent hotel overlooks the Tuileries Garden and is just a short walk from the Louvre Museum. It's a perfect blend of 18th-century splendor and contemporary comfort.\n\n3. **Four Seasons Hotel George V**: Located near the Champs-Élysées, this hotel is famous for its luxurious rooms, exquisite floral arrangements, and top-notch service.\n\n4. **Hôtel Plaza Athénée**: This hotel offers stunning views of the Eiffel Tower and is known for its Dior Institute spa, five restaurants, and the fact that it's considered a fashion institution itself.\n\nWhen booking your hotel, ensure that it offers the amenities you're interested in, such as a spa, a renowned restaurant, or a personal concierge service to help you with reservations and recommendations.\n\n**Visa Requirements:**\nAs a U.S. citizen, you can enter France for up to 90 days for tourist or business purposes without a visa. Ensure your passport is valid for at least three months beyond your planned date of departure from the Schengen area.\n\n**Travel Insurance:**\nIt's always wise to purchase travel insurance for international trips, covering trip cancellations, medical emergencies, and any other unexpected events.\n\n**Covid-19 Considerations:**\nWhile travel is returning to normal, it's important to stay informed about any Covid-19 requirements or restrictions that may be in place during your travel dates, both for entry into France and upon your return to the US.\n\nWould you like me to include any specific activities or experiences in your itinerary, such as a fashion show, cooking class, or a visit to a particular vineyard?

Let's dive into the specifics for your cooking class and wine tour.\n\n**Cooking Class:**\nFor an authentic, beginner-friendly cooking class in Paris, I recommend \"La Cuisine Paris\". They offer a variety of classes, including French market classes, where you'll visit a local market, choose your ingredients, and then learn to cook a traditional French meal. Another option could be \"Le Foodist\", which offers a unique approach to cooking classes by tying French cooking to French culture.\n\n**Wine Tour:**\nFor the wine tour, the Champagne region is about a 1.5-hour drive from Paris and is home to some of the world's most renowned Champagne houses. One highly recommended option is the \"Moët & Chandon Cellars\". A tour here includes a visit to their expansive cellars (the largest within the Champagne region), followed by a tasting session. Another great option is the \"Veuve Clicquot Champagne House\" which also offers a comprehensive tour from vineyard to tasting.\n\nAs for the fashion events, Paris is home to numerous fashion weeks throughout the year but most of them usually take place in January/February (Haute Couture Fashion Week) and September/October (Paris Fashion Week for Women's Wear). However, there are always smaller fashion events, shows, and exhibitions happening. I recommend checking the official Paris tourism website or fashion magazines for specific events closer to your travel dates.\n\nRemember to book your cooking class and wine tour in advance to secure your spot, as they can fill up quickly, especially during the holiday season. \n\nDoes this all sound good to you? If there are other details or activities you'd like me to look into, please let me know!",
