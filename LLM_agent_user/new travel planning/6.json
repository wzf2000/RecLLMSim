Morocco is an excellent choice for a jewelry designer, with its rich history of Berber jewelry and unique art and design. \n\n**Best Time to Visit Morocco**\nThe best time to visit Morocco is during the spring (mid-March to May) or fall (September to October). The weather is warm but not too hot, perfect for exploring. Summer (June to August) can be extremely hot, especially in Marrakech and the desert. \n\n**Rough Itinerary for a Month in Morocco**\nGiven your interests, here's a rough plan:\n\n**Week 1 - Marrakech**\nStart your journey in Marrakech. Visit the Medina, the historic city center, where you'll find traditional Moroccan crafts, including jewelry. Don't miss the Bahia Palace and the Majorelle Garden. You could also take a traditional jewelry-making workshop.\n\n**Week 2 - Atlas Mountains and Berber Villages**\nHead to the Atlas Mountains and spend a week visiting Berber villages like Imlil and Ait Benhaddou. Here, you can learn about traditional Berber jewelry techniques.\n\n**Week 3 - Essaouira**\nTravel to the coastal town of Essaouira. It's known for its relaxed atmosphere, beautiful beaches, and vibrant art scene. Attend local art workshops and explore the local markets.\n\n**Week 4 - Fez**\nFinish your trip in Fez. Visit the ancient medina, the world's largest living Islamic medieval city and a UNESCO site. Explore the local tanneries and ceramic workshops.\n\n**Visa Information**\nAs a US citizen, you can stay in Morocco for up to 90 days without a visa, so you shouldn't have any bureaucratic hassles.\n\n**Safety**\nMorocco is generally safe for tourists. However, like any other tourist destination, it's important to take precautions, especially in crowded areas. Avoid flashy displays of wealth and keep an eye on your belongings. \n\n**Accommodation**\nThroughout Morocco, you can find a range of accommodations, from luxury Riads (traditional houses) in Marrakech to cozy guesthouses in the Atlas Mountains.\n\n**Transportation**\nTrains and buses are reliable for long-distance travel between cities. For local transportation, taxis and even bicycles are commonly used.\n\nLet me know if this plan sounds appealing to you, or if you'd like more information about any aspect of the trip!",
