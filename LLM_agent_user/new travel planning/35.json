There are also several historical attractions related to World War II, such as the Alaska Veterans Museum and the Aleutians World War II National Historic Area.\n\nOn the other hand, Normandy, France, is known for its significant role in World War II, particularly the D-Day landings. The region is rich in historical attractions such as the D-Day Landing Beaches, the Caen Memorial Museum, and the American Cemetery. It also offers excellent fishing opportunities, especially sea fishing.\n\nBefore we move forward, could you kindly provide me with your starting point (usually your current location)?

            "content": "Absolutely, focusing on Normandy, France, for your two-week vacation sounds like a fantastic choice. Let's refine your travel plan based on your preferences.\n\n### 1. Flights from Washington D.C. to Normandy\n\n- **Direct Flights:** Direct flights from Washington D.C. to Paris are readily available. From Paris, the most convenient way to reach Normandy is by renting a car or taking a train to a major city in Normandy, such as Caen or Rouen. The drive from Paris to Normandy takes about 2-3 hours, depending on your exact destination within Normandy.\n  \n- **Suggestion:** Book a flight to Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) or Paris Orly Airport (ORY). From there, rent a car which will give you the flexibility to explore Normandy at your own pace.\n\n### 2. Accommodation\n\nGiven your preference for rental homes with good security and a well-equipped kitchen, I recommend using reputable vacation rental websites such as Airbnb, Vrbo, or Booking.com. Look for properties with high ratings and positive reviews regarding security and kitchen amenities. \n\n- **Location:** Consider staying in or near a central location like Bayeux or Caen. Bayeux is close to the D-Day beaches and has its own attractions, such as the Bayeux Tapestry. Caen is larger, with more amenities and historical sites such as the Caen Memorial Museum.\n\n### 3. Transportation in Normandy\n\nRenting a car is indeed the most convenient way to explore Normandy, giving you the flexibility to visit remote fishing spots and historical sites at your own pace. Make sure to book your car rental in advance for the best rates and availability, and check if you need an international driving permit.\n\n### 4. Itinerary Suggestions\n\n**Week 1:**\n\n- **Day 1-2:** Explore Paris. Visit iconic sites like the Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral.\n- **Day 3:** Travel to Normandy. Settle into your rental home. Explore the local area.\n- **Day 4:** Visit the D-Day Landing Beaches, including Omaha Beach and Utah Beach. Don't miss the Pointe du Hoc.\n- **Day 5:** Explore the town of Bayeux. See the Bayeux Tapestry and the Cathedral.\n- **Day 6:** Visit the American Cemetery and Memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer.\n- **Day 7:** Free day for fishing or exploring the countryside.\n\n**Week 2:**\n\n- **Day 8:** Visit Mont Saint-Michel.\n- **Day 9:** Explore Caen, including the Caen Memorial Museum.\n- **Day 10-11:** Enjoy local fishing spots. Consider guided fishing tours for the best experience.\n- **Day 12:** Visit the medieval city of Rouen.\n- **Day 13:** Free day. Perhaps enjoy a local cooking class or wine tasting.\n- **Day 14:** Return to Paris for departure.\n\n### 5. Additional Suggestions\n\n- **Visa Requirements:** As a U.S. citizen, you can enter France for up to 90 days for tourist purposes without a visa. Ensure your passport is valid for at least six months beyond your planned return date.\n- **Travel Insurance:** Consider purchasing comprehensive travel insurance that covers medical expenses, trip cancellations, and theft or loss of belongings.\n\nThis plan is just a starting point, and you can adjust the itinerary based on your family's interests and any specific sites you wish to visit. Would you like more information or help with booking any part of your trip?",
            "content_zh": "绝对，将诺曼底，法国作为您两周的度假目的地听起来是一个很棒的选择。让我们根据您的喜好来完善您的旅行计划。1.从华盛顿特区到诺曼底的航班-直达航班：从华盛顿特区到巴黎的直达航班非常方便。从巴黎到诺曼底最便利的方式是租一辆车或搭乘火车到诺曼底的主要城市，比如卡昂或鲁昂。从巴黎到诺曼底的车程大约需要2-3小时，这取决于您在诺曼底的确切目的地。建议：预订到巴黎戴高乐机场（CDG）或巴黎奥利机场（ORY）的航班。从那里租一辆车，这样您就可以按自己的节奏探索诺曼底。2.住宿考虑到您偏爱带有良好安全性和设备齐全厨房的出租房屋，我建议使用知名的度假出租网站，比如Airbnb、Vrbo或Booking.com。寻找评分高且有关安全和厨房设施的积极评价的物业。地点：考虑住在或靠近像巴约或卡昂这样的中心地带。巴约靠近诺曼底登陆海滩，并且有许多吸引人的地方，比如巴约刺绣。卡昂更大，有更多的设施和历史遗址，比如卡昂纪念博物馆。3.诺曼底的交通确实租车是探索诺曼底最便利的方式，可以让您自由地以自己的节奏参观偏远的渔村和历史遗址。确保提前预订您的租车，以获得最优惠的价格和可用性，并检查您是否需要国际驾驶执照。4.行程建议第一周：-第1-2天：探索巴黎。参观象埃菲尔铁塔、卢浮宫和巴黎圣母院等标志性景点。-第3天：前往诺曼底。入住您的度假住宅。探索当地地区。-第4天：参观诺曼底登陆海滩，包括奥马哈海滩和犹他海滩。不要错过奥克角。-第5天：探索巴约市。看看巴约刺绣和大教堂。-第6天：参观科尔维尔-梅尔的美国公墓和纪念碑。-第7天：自由日，可以钓鱼或探索乡村。第二周：-第8天：参观圣米歇尔山。-第9天：探索卡昂，包括卡昂纪念博物馆。-第10-11天：享受本地的钓鱼点。考虑参加钓鱼游览，以获得最佳体验。-第12天：参观鲁昂这座中世纪城市。-第13天：自由日。也许可以享受当地的烹饪课程或品酒。-第14天：返回巴黎，准备离开。5.额外建议签证要求：作为美国公民，您可以免签证在法国停留长达90天的旅游目的。确保您的护照在计划返回日期之后至少六个月有效。旅行保险：考虑购买全面的旅行保险，涵盖医疗费用、旅行取消以及财产被盗或丢失。这个计划只是一个起点，您可以根据您家人的兴趣和您希望参观的具体景点来调整行程。您是否需要更多信息或需要帮助预订您旅行的任何部分吗？",
