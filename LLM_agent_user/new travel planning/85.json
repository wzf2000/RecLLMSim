Here's a preliminary plan for your weekend trip to Xi'an:\n\n**Day 1: Arrival and Explore Downtown**\n\n- Flight from Beijing to Xi'an: Flights usually take around 2 hours. Consider taking an early flight to maximize your day.\n\n- Check in at your hotel: I recommend the \"Grand Mercure Xian on Renmin Square\". It's a quiet hotel in the city center, well-rated for its comfort and service.\n\n- Lunch: Try some local Xi'an specialties at \"Fan Ji La Zhi Rou Jia Mo\", which is famous for its Chinese burgers.\n\n- Afternoon and Evening: Visit the Ancient City Wall. You can walk, bike, or take a buggy ride around the wall. Post that, explore the Muslim Quarter, where you can try various street foods and visit the Great Mosque.\n\n**Day 2: Historical Tour**\n\n- Morning: Visit the Terracotta Warriors and Horses. It's advisable to reach early to avoid crowds.\n\n- Lunch: Have lunch at the on-site restaurant in the Terracotta Warriors Museum.\n\n- Afternoon: Visit the Big Wild Goose Pagoda. Explore the North Square with its lovely fountains, and if time permits, check out the Da Ci'en Temple.\n\n- Dinner: Try some authentic Shaanxi cuisine at \"De Fa Chang Restaurant\".\n\n**Day 3: Departure**\n\n- Morning: Depending on your flight time, you might want to visit the Shaanxi History Museum or do some last-minute souvenir shopping.\n\n- Return Flight to Beijing.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like any adjustments or additional recommendations!",

Let's refine it based on your feedback:\n\nThe Terracotta Warriors site is approximately an hour's drive from the Big Wild Goose Pagoda. It's feasible to visit both in a day, but as you mentioned, it might be tiring. An alternative could be to return to your hotel for a short rest after the Terracotta Warriors, then visit the Big Wild Goose Pagoda in the evening when it's beautifully lit up.\n\n\"De Fa Chang Restaurant\" is quite popular, so it can get busy at peak hours. For a quieter dining experience, you might want to consider \"First Noodle Under The Sun\", which is known for its delicious and unique noodle dishes and generally quieter atmosphere.\n\nOn the morning of Day 3, if you're short on time, you could explore the area around your hotel. Renmin Square is a peaceful place for a morning walk. The nearby Xiangzi Temple is also worth a visit and is usually less crowded. Alternatively, you could spend the morning at a local tea house, such as \"Zhiweiguan Tea House\", experiencing the traditional Chinese tea culture before you depart.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on these suggestions!",
