This might include shampoo, conditioner, soap, and toothpaste. Also, pack a good quality, reef-safe sunscreen and eco-friendly insect repellent.\n\n3. **Reusable water bottle**: Tap water is generally safe to drink in Costa Rica, so a reusable water bottle will keep you hydrated and minimize plastic waste.\n\n4. **Yoga clothes and gear**: If you have a lightweight travel yoga mat, you might want to bring it along.
