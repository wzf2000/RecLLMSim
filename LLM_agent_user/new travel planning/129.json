It's home to numerous historical sites, including Machu Picchu and other Incan ruins. The country has diverse ecosystems, including the Amazon rainforest, Andean highlands, and coastal areas. Peruvian cuisine is considered one of the best in South America, with dishes like ceviche and lomo saltado. The weather in the Peruvian winter (which corresponds to the North American summer) is generally mild, especially in the highlands.\n\nBoth countries have plenty of green spaces and are not usually overly crowded, especially if you plan to visit less touristy areas or cities.\n\nBefore I provide more detailed suggestions, could you let me know which option interests you more?
