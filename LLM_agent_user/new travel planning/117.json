Both offer a mix of cultural experiences and natural attractions.\n\nJapan is rich in culture and history, and has a wide array of attractions for all ages. You can explore ancient temples and shrines, visit museums, and enjoy beautiful parks and gardens. There are also plenty of kid-friendly attractions like Disneyland Tokyo and Universal Studios. Japan's public transportation system is excellent, which makes traveling around the country very convenient.\n\nCosta Rica, on the other hand, offers a wealth of natural attractions. You can visit national parks, explore rainforests, relax on beautiful beaches, and participate in activities like zip-lining and wildlife tours. Costa Rica is also known for its relaxed, family-friendly culture.\n\nFor both destinations, a direct flight from New York City would be around 6-7 hours to Costa Rica and around 14 hours to Japan. \n\nBefore we dive deeper into planning for either of these destinations, do you and your children have valid passports? If you're considering Japan, you should also check if a visa is required for your stay. As of now, U.S. citizens can enter Japan as tourists for up to 90 days without a visa, but it's always a good idea to check the current regulations.",
