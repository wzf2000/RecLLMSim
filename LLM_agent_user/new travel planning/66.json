It's a wise decision to book your accommodation early, especially since you'll be traveling during the holiday season.\n\nRegarding transportation, I'll provide you with a sample flight itinerary for both your departure to Asheville and your return to New York. As I don't have live access to current flight databases, I recommend using flight comparison websites such as Google Flights, Kayak, or Expedia to find the most up-to-date options and prices.

Given that you're interested in nature activities and visiting locations such as the Blue Ridge Parkway and the Great Smoky Mountains, which are outside of the city center, renting a car would be the most practical option. It will give you the freedom to explore the region at your own pace and access more remote areas for walking and bird watching.\n\n### Car Rental:\n- **Pick-up/Drop-off:** Asheville Regional Airport (AVL)\n- **Rental Duration:** 14 days to match your stay\n- **Vehicle Type:** An economy or compact car should suffice, but consider a vehicle with comfortable seating for longer drives and adequate space for any gear you may have.\n\n**Please ensure you have a valid driver's license and insurance coverage for car rental.**\n\nWould you like to proceed with finding a car rental, or do you need further assistance with booking your flights?",
