Week 1 & 2: Start in Europe. You can visit cities like London (London Stock Exchange), Frankfurt (European Central Bank), and Zurich (Swiss Financial Market). These cities are also known for their historical sites, museums, and active experiences such as cycling along the River Thames in London, hiking in the Swiss Alps, and exploring the parks and gardens of Frankfurt. \n\n2.

You can also partake in yoga classes or go cycling through the beautiful Balinese countryside.\n\nBefore we proceed, I'll need to check the visa requirements for these countries based on your nationality.
