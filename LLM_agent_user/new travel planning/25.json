            "content": "Absolutely, we can work with those preferences to plan an unforgettable trip to New Zealand for you. Let's outline your trip:\n\n### Flight from San Francisco to New Zealand\nDirect flights from San Francisco to New Zealand are limited, but there are some options that fly directly into Auckland, which is a great starting point for your adventure. Airlines like Air New Zealand offer direct flights, but be sure to book in advance to get the best deal. Considering your travel in December, it's peak season due to the southern hemisphere summer, so early booking is advisable.\n\n### Accommodation\nGiven your preference for eco-friendly lodges or guesthouses near nature reserves or parks, I recommend focusing on areas like the outskirts of Auckland for the start, then moving towards Rotorua, and finally Queenstown. These locations offer proximity to natural attractions and have options that cater to vegan diets.\n\n1. **Auckland Area**: A great starting point with several eco-lodges and guesthouses. The Waitakere Ranges are nearby, offering lush rainforests and beaches. \n2. **Rotorua**: Known for its geothermal activity and Maori culture, Rotorua is surrounded by nature. Eco-friendly accommodations here often offer stunning views and easy access to hiking trails.\n3. **Queenstown**: Famous for its adventure sports and breathtaking landscapes, including lakes, mountains, and fjords. Eco-accommodations here can be a bit pricier, but there are hidden gems that fit within your budget.\n\n### Itinerary Suggestions\n- **Auckland (3 Days)**: Explore the city, visit the Auckland Art Gallery, take day trips to the Waitakere Ranges for hiking and photography.\n- **Rotorua (4 Days)**: Visit Wai-O-Tapu Thermal Wonderland, hike in the Redwoods Forest, experience a traditional Maori hangi meal (special vegan options can be requested).\n- **Queenstown (7 Days)**: Take day trips to Milford Sound and Fiordland National Park, try the famous Routeburn Track for hiking, explore local vegan eateries, and don’t miss capturing the sunrise over Lake Wakatipu.\n\n### Transportation\nRenting a car might be the most convenient way to explore New Zealand at your own pace, especially for accessing remote hiking trails and nature reserves. New Zealand drives on the left, so be prepared for that. Alternatively, there are inter-city buses and domestic flights for longer distances.\n\n### Vegan Food\nNew Zealand is quite vegan-friendly, especially in larger towns and cities. Auckland, Rotorua, and Queenstown all have good selections of vegan restaurants. Apps like HappyCow can help you find local vegan options.\n\n### Other Considerations\n- **Visa**: As a US citizen, you'll need to apply for an NZeTA (New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority) before your trip.\n- **Safety**: New Zealand is generally very safe for travelers. Still, always follow local advice, especially when hiking or exploring remote areas.\n- **Health Insurance**: Make sure you have travel insurance that covers medical expenses and evacuation, just in case.\n\nThis is a rough outline to get us started. Would you like to adjust or expand on any parts of this plan?",
            "content_zh": "绝对可以根据您的偏好规划一次难忘的新西兰之行。让我们来概括一下您的行程：\n\n### 从旧金山到新西兰的航班\n直飞旧金山到新西兰的航班有限，但有一些选择可以直飞奥克兰，这是您冒险之旅的绝佳起点。像新西兰航空这样的航空公司提供直飞航班，但一定要提前预订以获得最优惠的价格。考虑到您12月的旅行时间，由于南半球夏季的旺季，建议提前预订。\n\n### 住宿\n鉴于您喜欢生态友好型小屋或靠近自然保护区或公园的客栈，我建议您从奥克兰郊区开始，然后前往罗托鲁瓦，最后前往皇后镇。这些地点靠近自然景点，并且有满足素食饮食的选择。\n1. **奥克兰地区**：有几家生态小屋和客栈，是一个绝佳的起点。附近有Waitakere Ranges，提供郁郁葱葱的雨林和海滩。\n2. **罗托鲁瓦**：以地热活动和毛利文化而闻名，罗托鲁瓦被大自然环抱。这里的生态友好型住宿经常可以欣赏到美丽的景色，并且可以方便地前往远足步道。\n3. **皇后镇**：以其冒险运动和令人叹为观止的湖泊、山脉和峡湾而闻名。这里的生态住宿可能会偏贵，但也有符合您预算的隐藏宝地。\n\n### 行程建议\n- **奥克兰（3天）**：探索城市，参观奥克兰美术馆，在Waitakere Ranges进行远足和摄影的日游。\n- **罗托鲁瓦（4天）**：参观Wai-O-Tapu地热仙境，在Redwoods Forest徒步，体验传统毛利晚宴（可以提供特别的素食选择）。\n- **皇后镇（7天）**：到米尔福德峡湾和菲奥德兰国家公园进行日游，在著名的Routeburn Track徒步，探索当地的素食餐馆，不要错过在瓦卡蒂普湖上捕捉日出。\n\n### 交通\n租车可能是探索新西兰以自己的节奏前进的最方便的方式，尤其是用于到达偏远远足步道和自然保护区。新西兰靠左行驶，所以要有所准备。或者，也可以选择市际巴士和国内航班来覆盖更长的距离。\n\n### 素食食品\n新西兰对素食友好，特别是在较大的城镇和城市。奥克兰、罗托鲁瓦和皇后镇都有不错的素食餐馆。像HappyCow这样的应用可以帮助您找到当地的素食选择。\n\n### 其他考虑\n- **签证**：作为美国公民，您需要在旅行前申请NZeTA（新西兰电子旅行授权）。\n- **安全**：新西兰对游客来说通常是非常安全的。不过，在徒步旅行或探索偏远地区时，始终遵循当地建议尤为重要。\n- **健康保险**：确保您有旅行保险，以便支付医疗费用和撤离费用，以防万一。\n\n这只是一个大致的概要，我们可以从这个计划的任何部分进行调整或扩展，您有什么想要调整或扩展的吗？",

Let's address your queries and adjust the plan to better suit your preferences.\n\n### Eco-Friendly Accommodations\nI'll provide a few options in each area that are eco-friendly and should fall within your budget.\n\n**Auckland**:\n- **The Great Ponsonby Arthotel**: This charming bed & breakfast is set in a historic building and is known for its commitment to sustainability. It's close to public transport that can take you to the Waitakere Ranges.\n- **City Garden Lodge**: Located in a quieter area of Auckland, this budget-friendly option has a garden setting and is within easy reach of public transport.\n\n**Rotorua**:\n- **Rotorua Planet Backpackers**: This eco-conscious hostel is centrally located and offers easy access to public transportation to nature reserves.\n- **Aura Accommodation**: A sustainable stay with geothermal heating and a focus on green practices. They are committed to the environment and also centrally located.\n\n**Queenstown**:\n- **Pinewood Lodge**: Offers affordable and eco-friendly accommodation. They have a variety of room options and are located in a peaceful setting near the town center.\n- **Sherwood Queenstown**: A bit more upscale but still within budget, Sherwood has a strong commitment to sustainability, an on-site vegetable garden, and gorgeous views of the surrounding landscapes.\n\n### Itinerary Adjustments\nLet's focus more on nature and less on urban environments:\n\n- **Day 1-2: Auckland**: Visit the Auckland Botanic Gardens and take a ferry to Waiheke Island for vineyards, beaches, and walking trails.\n- **Day 3-5: Coromandel Peninsula**: A couple of hours drive from Auckland, offering stunning beaches and native forests. You can take a bus or join a tour. Visit Cathedral Cove and Hot Water Beach.\n- **Day 6-10: Rotorua and Taupo**: Visit Wai-O-Tapu, hike in the Redwoods, and extend to Lake Taupo for more nature experiences. You can take intercity buses or small group tours to these locations.\n- **Day 11-14: Queenstown and Surrounds**: Base yourself in Queenstown. Use tour services to visit Milford Sound, Fiordland National Park, and perhaps the Glenorchy area for its walking tracks and beautiful scenery.\n\n### Public Transportation and Tours\nIn New Zealand, intercity buses are reliable and can take you between towns and cities. For nature reserves and parks, you'll often find that there are local shuttle services or tour companies that offer day trips. Tour companies are particularly useful for getting to more remote locations like Milford Sound.\n\nFor your specific interests in painting and photography, you may want to consider joining specialized tours. Some companies offer photography tours, which not only provide transportation but also guide you to the best spots for capturing the natural beauty of the landscape.\n\n### Next Steps\nWith these adjustments, you should have a trip that focuses more on nature and less on city life, with sustainable accommodations and a reliance on public transportation and tours rather than driving yourself.\n\nWould you like to proceed with booking any of these accommodations or tours, or do you have any further questions or preferences to discuss?",
            "content_zh": "当然！让我们解决您的疑问，并调整计划以更好地满足您的偏好。### 环保住宿 我将在每个地区提供一些符合您预算的环保选择。 奥克兰： - 大彭森比艺术酒店：这家迷人的家庭旅馆位于一座历史悠久的建筑中，以其对可持续性的承诺而闻名。它靠近公共交通，可以带您前往怀塔克雷山脉。 - 城市花园旅舍：位于奥克兰的一个较为安静的地区，这个预算友好型选项拥有花园景致，并且方便乘坐公共交通工具。 罗托鲁瓦： -罗托鲁瓦星球背包客旅馆：这家环保的青年旅舍位于市中心，提供前往自然保护区的公共交通便利。 -奥拉住宿：这是一个拥有地热供暖并专注于绿色实践的可持续住宿。他们致力于环保，并且位于市中心。 皇后镇： -Pine Wood 旅馆：提供价格适宜且环保的住宿。他们有各种房间选择，并且位于镇中心附近一个宁静的环境中。 -Sherwood 皇后镇：略微高档但仍在预算范围内，Sherwood 致力于可持续性，拥有蔬菜园，并且可以欣赏周围风景。### 行程调整 让我们更多地关注自然，而不是城市环境： - 第1-2天：奥克兰：参观奥克兰植物园，乘坐渡轮前往怀赫凯岛，那里有葡萄园、海滩和步道。 - 第3-5天：科罗曼德尔半岛：距离奥克兰几小时车程，那里有令人惊叹的海滩和原始森林。您可以乘坐公共汽车或参加旅行团。参观大教堂洞和温泉海滩。 -第6-10天：罗托鲁瓦和陶波：参观Wai-O-Tapu，在红木林徒步，并延伸至陶波湖，以获得更多自然体验。您可以乘坐市际公交车或小团旅行前往这些地区。 - 第11-14天：皇后镇及其周边地区：住在皇后镇。使用旅游服务参观米尔福德峡湾、菲奥德兰国家公园，也可以去格伦奥尔基地区，那里有徒步径和美丽的风景。### 公共交通和旅游 在新西兰，市际公共汽车很可靠，可以在城镇和城市之间运行。对于自然保护区和公园，您通常会发现当地的班车服务或旅行社会提供一日游。旅行社对于到达像米尔福德峡湾这样更偏远地区尤其有用。 针对您对绘画和摄影的特殊兴趣，您可能希望考虑参加专门的旅行团。一些旅行社提供摄影旅行，这不仅提供交通，还会引导您前往拍摄自然风光最佳地点。### 下一步 随着这些调整，您应该会有一次更加关注自然而不是城市生活，拥有可持续住宿，依赖公共交通和旅游，而不是自驾的旅行。 您是否想要继续预订任何这些住宿或旅游，或者您是否有任何进一步的问题或偏好要讨论？",

Now, let's address your new queries:\n\n1. **Vaccinations**: There are no specific vaccinations required for New Zealand unless you're coming from a country with a risk of yellow fever. However, it's always a good idea to be up-to-date with routine vaccinations such as MMR, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis and varicella (chickenpox). If you plan on doing a lot of outdoor activities, you might consider a tetanus shot if you're not already up-to-date.\n\n2. **Safety in Nature**: New Zealand's wildlife is generally not dangerous. The country does not have any snakes or dangerous large mammals. However, it's crucial to be aware of the weather and terrain conditions when hiking. Always stick to marked trails, inform someone of your hiking plans, and have a reliable way to call for help if necessary. Insects like sandflies can be a nuisance in some areas, so insect repellent might be useful. \n\n3. **Weather in December**: December is the start of summer in New Zealand. You can expect daytime temperatures ranging from 15°C (59°F) to 25°C (77°F). In the northern parts (like Auckland and Coromandel), it's generally warmer and more humid. In Queenstown, it can be cooler, especially in the evenings. Remember, the weather can change quickly, especially in mountainous areas, so packing layers is a good idea.\n\n4. **Pet Sitting Services in San Francisco**: There are several reliable pet sitting services in San Francisco. A few to consider are:\n   - **Fetch! Pet Care**: Offers pet sitting, dog walking, and overnight stays.\n   - **Wag!**: A popular app that offers pet sitting and dog walking services.\n   - **Rover**: Allows you to find local pet sitters who can take care of your cat in their own home or yours.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if there's anything else you need assistance with.",
            "content_zh": "很高兴听到修改后的计划符合您的喜好！现在，让我们来解决您的新问题：\n1. **疫苗接种**：除非您来自有黄热病风险的国家，否则新西兰没有特定的疫苗接种要求。但是，及时更新麻疹-腮腺炎-风疹（MMR）、百白破和水痘等常规疫苗总是个好主意。如果您打算进行很多户外活动，那么如果您的疫苗接种还没有更新，可能需要考虑接种破伤风疫苗。\n2. **大自然安全**：新西兰的野生动植物通常不具危险性。该国没有蛇或危险的大型哺乳动物。但是，在徒步旅行时，了解天气和地形条件非常关键。始终要沿着标记的小径行走，告知他人您的徒步计划，并且具备在必要时寻求帮助的可靠途径。在一些地区，像沙蝇这样的昆虫可能会让人感到困扰，所以昆虫防护剂可能会很有用。\n3. **十二月天气**：十二月是新西兰的夏天开始的季节。白天的气温预计会在15°C（59°F）到25°C（77°F）之间。在北部地区（比如奥克兰和科罗曼德尔），通常会更温暖和湿润。在皇后镇，尤其是晚上可能会比较凉爽。记住，天气可能会迅速变化，尤其是在山区，所以多携带一些衣物是个好主意。\n4. **旧金山的宠物寄养服务**：旧金山有几家可靠的宠物寄养服务。您可以考虑以下几家：\n   - **Fetch! Pet Care**：提供宠物寄养、遛狗和过夜照料服务。\n   - **Wag!**：一款流行的应用程序，提供宠物寄养和遛狗服务。\n   - **Rover**：让您找到能在自己家或别人家照看您的猫的本地宠物寄养人。希望这些能帮到您！如果您还需要帮助，请随时让我知道。",
