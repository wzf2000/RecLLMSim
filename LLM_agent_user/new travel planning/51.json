Let me answer your questions:\n\n1. **Healthy Dining**: In Arenal, 'Organic Cafe' is a great option for fresh salads and healthy meals. They have vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options too. When you're on the Pacific Coast, 'Koji's' is a fantastic place for sushi and salads. In Monteverde, try 'Whole Foods Monteverde' for a variety of healthy meals including salads, sandwiches, and smoothies. \n\n2. **Yoga Sessions**: The yoga sessions at Nayara Springs and Florblanca Resort are suitable for all levels. You can inform the instructor about your regular practice and they can adjust or provide more challenging poses for you. \n\n3. **Canopy Tour**: The canopy tour consists of a series of zip-lines strung from treetop to treetop. You're secured in a harness and wear a helmet. While it can be a bit scary if you're afraid of heights, the safety measures are top-notch and guides are trained to help you feel comfortable. It's a thrilling way to experience the rainforest from above and see wildlife that you might not spot from the ground. However, if you decide it's not for you, there are plenty of other activities to enjoy.\n\n4. **Carbon Offsetting**: This is a way to balance out your carbon emissions by investing in projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gases elsewhere. You can offset the carbon footprint of your flight by using online calculators like those at MyClimate or Carbon Footprint to calculate the emissions of your trip, then donate the corresponding amount to a project. It's a way to travel more sustainably and responsibly.\n\n5. **Travel Insurance**: For comprehensive coverage, World Nomads offers plans that cover a wide range of scenarios, including trip cancellation, medical emergencies, travel delays, and even adventure sports. It's a reputable company widely used by travelers worldwide. However, always read the policy details to ensure it fits your specific needs.\n\nI hope this provides the information you need.
