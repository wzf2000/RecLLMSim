It's a vibrant city with a rich culture, and it's known for its unique blend of French, African, and American traditions, especially reflected in its food.\n\n1. **Attractions:** The city is home to many parks and nature reserves that would be perfect for bird watching. The Barataria Preserve, for example, offers a chance to see wildlife in its natural habitats, including various bird species. City Park, a 1,300-acre outdoor oasis, has been enchanting New Orleanians since 1854, making it one of the nation's oldest urban parks. \n\n2. **Cuisine:** As for traditional dishes, New Orleans is a food lover's paradise. Known for its Creole and Cajun cuisines, you can enjoy dishes like gumbo, jambalaya, and crawfish etouffee. For a taste of the local culinary scene, I recommend dining at popular spots like Commander's Palace, Dooky Chase's Restaurant, or Café du Monde for their world-famous beignets.\n\n3. **Accommodation:** Considering your budget, I suggest staying at a mid-range hotel in the French Quarter, such as the Bourbon Orleans Hotel or the Hotel St. Pierre, which have rooms typically ranging from $150-$200 per night.\n\n4. **Transportation:** As for getting there, Charleston to New Orleans is a 12-hour drive. If you'd rather not drive, you can find round-trip flights typically in the $200-$300 range.\n\n5. **Itinerary:** Since you're looking for a relaxed trip, I'd suggest spending one day for bird-watching and exploring nature, one day exploring the city and its culinary delights, and perhaps an evening enjoying some live jazz music, another of New Orleans' famous traditions.\n\nBefore we proceed with detailed planning, does New Orleans sound like a good fit for your travel desires?",

Many airlines, such as Delta, American Airlines, and United, offer pet-friendly travel options. You should check their pet policies to see what would work best for you and your furry friend. Most airlines charge a fee for pet travel, which varies but is often around $125 each way.\n\nAs for the accommodation, there are many pet-friendly hotels in New Orleans.

Also, consider the size and temperament of your dog when choosing a hotel.\n\nAs for the city itself, New Orleans is quite pet-friendly with numerous parks and even some pet-friendly restaurants and cafes, so you'll find plenty of activities to enjoy with your dog.\n\nI hope this addresses your concerns.
