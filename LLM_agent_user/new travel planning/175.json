Given your interests and preferences, I'd recommend considering Paris, France. It's renowned for its culinary scene, has a wealth of landmarks and museums, and is known for its high-quality wine.\n\nHere's a rough plan for your trip:\n\n**Day 1:** \nArrive in Paris. Check into a 4-star hotel, such as the Hotel Le A, which is centrally located and offers easy access to many attractions. After settling in, you can start your trip with a visit to the iconic Eiffel Tower.\n\n**Day 2:**\nBegin your day with a visit to the Louvre Museum to see the world-famous Mona Lisa and other masterpieces. In the afternoon, why not take a food tour? Paris by Mouth offers a great tour that covers cheese, wine, and bread tastings.\n\n**Day 3:**\nTake a day trip to the Champagne region for a wine tasting tour. Many companies offer these tours, which typically include transportation, visits to vineyards, and tasting sessions. \n\n**Day 4:**\nSpend your last day exploring Montmartre, a historic and artistic neighborhood. Here, you can visit the Basilica of the Sacré-Cœur and enjoy panoramic views of the city. In the evening, enjoy a farewell dinner at a Michelin-star restaurant, like Le Comptoir du Relais.\n\nRegarding transportation, round-trip flights from New York City to Paris in December usually range from $400 to $600. Once in Paris, the city has an efficient public transportation system, but you can also consider getting a 2- or 3-day hop-on hop-off bus pass to navigate around the city.\n\nPlease note that you'll need a passport to travel to France from the US, and as of 2022, US citizens will also need an ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorization System) visa waiver for short stays.\n\nDoes this itinerary sound good to you? I can provide more details and adjust it according to your preferences.",
