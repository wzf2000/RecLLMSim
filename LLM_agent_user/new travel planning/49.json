This route would give you a mix of historical sites, great food, festivals, and possibly concerts. The total driving time is around 23 hours, spread over a fortnight making it quite comfortable.\n\n2. **Southern Road Trip:** You could head down the South, visit cities like Philadelphia, Nashville (known for its country music), New Orleans (known for its jazz music and festivals), and possibly end up in Austin, Texas. This route will offer you a mix of music, food, and history. The total driving time is around 30 hours.\n\n3. **West Coast Road Trip:** You could head west and visit cities like Chicago, St. Louis, Denver, Las Vegas, and finally end up in Los Angeles or San Francisco. This route would give you a mix of nature, concerts, food, and historic sites. The total driving time is quite long, around 45 hours.\n\nBefore we dive deeper into one of these options, do you have any preferences, or would you like to know more about a specific route?

Local newspapers or magazines often also have event listings. In Nashville, the Nashville Scene is a good source, and in New Orleans, you can check out OffBeat Magazine.\n\nI hope this helps!
