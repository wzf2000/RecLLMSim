Add personal touches: Include handwritten notes, doodles, or captions alongside the photos in the album. This will make the memories even more meaningful and show your personal touch.\n\n2. Theme or story: Organize the photo album around a specific theme or tell a story. For example, you could create a \"Year in Review\" album, highlighting the best moments you shared together over the past year.\n\n3. Decorate the album: Get creative with the presentation. Use decorative paper, stickers, or washi tape to add flair to the photo album. You could also include small keepsakes like dried flowers or ticket stubs from special events.\n\n4. Thoughtful captions: Write heartfelt captions or short anecdotes beside each photo. This will give your boyfriend a glimpse into your thoughts and emotions during those moments.\n\n5.

Think about what he enjoys most and offer activities or gestures that he would truly appreciate. You can also decorate the coupons with his favorite colors or drawings that represent your relationship.\n\n6. Presentation matters: Consider presenting the gift in a creative way.
