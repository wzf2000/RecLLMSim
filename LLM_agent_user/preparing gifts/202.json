Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Handwritten letter: Write a heartfelt letter expressing your gratitude and appreciation for your teacher's guidance and support. Personalized messages often have a lasting impact.\n\n2. Homemade treats: If you enjoy baking or cooking, consider making some delicious homemade treats like cookies, brownies, or a small cake. Wrap them nicely and include a note expressing your appreciation.\n\n3. Personalized stationery: Get a set of personalized stationery with your teacher's name or initials. It's a practical gift that can be used for writing notes or grading papers.\n\n4. Potted plant: A small potted plant, like a succulent or a mini herb garden, can be a lovely gift. It adds a touch of nature to their workspace and requires minimal care.\n\n5. Book or journal: If you know your teacher's interests, consider gifting them a book related to their field or a journal for personal reflections. It shows that you value their knowledge and passion.\n\n6. Classroom supplies: Teachers often spend their own money on classroom supplies. Consider gifting some essential items like colorful markers, sticky notes, or a nice set of pens. It's practical and thoughtful.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your appreciation and thoughtfulness. It's the gesture that matters, not the price tag. Good luck with your gift preparations!",
            "content_zh": "你好！你考虑给你的老师准备一份体贴的礼物真是太棒了。有很多想法既有意义又符合预算。以下是一些建议：\n\n1. 手写信：写一封真挚的信，表达你对老师引导和支持的感激之情。个性化的信息通常会产生持久的影响。\n\n2. 自制美食：如果你喜欢烘焙或烹饪，可以考虑制作一些美味的自制美食，如饼干、布朗尼或一个小蛋糕。精美包装它们，并附上一张表达感激之情的便笺。\n\n3. 个性化文具：为老师购买一套印有他们名字或缩写的个性化文具。这是一份实用的礼物，可用于写笔记或批改试卷。\n\n4. 盆栽植物：一盆小型盆栽植物，如多肉植物或迷你香草园，会是一个可爱的礼物。它为他们的工作空间增添自然气息，且需要最少的照料。\n\n5. 书籍或日记本：如果你了解老师的兴趣，考虑赠送与其领域相关的书籍或个人反思的日记本。这表明你重视他们的知识和热情。\n\n6. 教室用品：老师通常会花自己的钱购买教室用品。考虑赠送一些必备物品，如彩色记号笔、便签或一套好看的钢笔。这既实用又体贴。\n\n记住，最重要的是要表达你的感激和体贴。重要的是表示，而非价格标签。祝你准备礼物顺利！",
