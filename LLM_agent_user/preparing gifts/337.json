You could also consider a LEGO Technic set, which combines building with mechanical functions.\n\n3. Science Experiment Kit: Since he has an interest in science and technology, a science experiment kit could be a great gift. Look for kits that allow him to conduct fun and educational experiments at home, exploring topics like chemistry, physics, or electronics.\n\n4. Puzzle or Brain Teaser: Consider a challenging puzzle or brain teaser game that can keep him engaged and entertained. There are various options available, such as Rubik's Cubes, 3D puzzles, or even escape room-style board games.\n\n5. Book or Magazine Subscription: If he enjoys reading, you could gift him a book related to his interests, such as a novel based on a video game or a science fiction adventure. Alternatively, a subscription to a science or gaming magazine could provide him with regular reading material.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose a gift that aligns with his interests and passions.
