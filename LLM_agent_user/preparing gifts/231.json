Sports equipment: Consider getting him a new basketball or soccer ball, or even a set of cones for practicing drills. These can be affordable and encourage his love for outdoor activities.\n\n2. Video games: If he enjoys playing video games, you could look into getting him a new game for his console or a gift card for an online gaming store. This way, he can choose a game he's excited about.\n\n3. DIY art kit: Since he's creative, he might appreciate an art kit that allows him to explore different mediums like drawing, painting, or sculpting. Look for kits that are age-appropriate and within your budget.\n\n4. Building sets: Consider getting him a building set, such as Lego or other construction toys. These can engage his creativity and problem-solving skills while providing hours of fun.\n\n5. Outdoor adventure gear: If he enjoys outdoor activities, you could consider getting him a camping or hiking gear accessory, like a flashlight, compass, or a water bottle with a fun design.\n\nRemember, it's the thought that counts, so even if you decide to make something yourself, like a personalized sports jersey or a handmade art piece, that could be a meaningful and budget-friendly gift option too. I hope these suggestions help!",
