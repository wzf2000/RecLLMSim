It could include items like scented candles, bath salts, essential oils, or a soft robe.\n\n4. Subscription to her favorite magazine or book club: If your grandmother enjoys reading, consider gifting her a subscription to her favorite magazine or a book club membership. This way, she can receive new reading material regularly.\n\n5. Handmade crafts or artwork: If you're feeling creative, you could make something special for your grandmother. It could be a handmade card, a painting, a knitted scarf, or any other craft that showcases your skills and thoughtfulness.\n\nRemember, the most important aspect of a gift is the sentiment behind it. Consider your grandmother's interests, hobbies, and preferences when making your choice. I hope these ideas help you find the perfect gift within your budget.",
