Thoughtful gifts don't always have to be expensive, so let's brainstorm some ideas that fit within a reasonable budget. \n\nOne option is to personalize a gift. You could create a handwritten letter expressing your gratitude and sharing some memorable moments you've had in their class. Teachers often appreciate heartfelt messages that acknowledge their impact on students' lives.\n\nAnother idea is to make a DIY gift. You could create a small scrapbook featuring photos, quotes, or drawings related to your time in their class. It's a personal and creative way to show your appreciation. You could also make a personalized bookmark or a set of handmade thank-you cards.\n\nIf you prefer to buy a gift, consider something practical and useful. For example, a nice pen or a journal can be great options. You could also get a small potted plant or a desk organizer to help keep their workspace tidy.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is the thought and effort you put into the gift. It's the gesture that counts, so choose something that reflects your gratitude and appreciation for your teacher. I hope these ideas help you find the perfect gift!",
