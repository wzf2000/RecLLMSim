It's always heartwarming to show our loved ones how much we care. I'd be happy to help you brainstorm some ideas within a reasonable budget.\n\nOne idea could be to create a personalized photo album or scrapbook filled with cherished memories of your time together. You could include photos, handwritten notes, and even small mementos. It's a thoughtful and sentimental gift that she can treasure.\n\nIf your grandmother enjoys tea or coffee, you could consider getting her a high-quality tea set or a personalized mug. You could even pair it with her favorite blend of tea or coffee for an extra touch.\n\nAnother idea is to make a homemade gift, like a knitted scarf or a handcrafted piece of jewelry. These gifts can be both meaningful and unique, showing the effort and love you put into making something special just for her.\n\nIf your grandmother enjoys reading, you could get her a book by her favorite author or explore new genres that she might enjoy. Alternatively, you could gift her a subscription to a magazine or an audiobook service, allowing her to indulge in her favorite pastime.\n\nLastly, consider spending quality time with your grandmother on the Double Ninth Festival. Plan a day out together, perhaps going for a picnic in a park or visiting a place that holds special meaning for both of you. Sometimes, the most precious gift we can give is our time and undivided attention.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose a gift that reflects your grandmother's interests and preferences. I hope these ideas inspire you, and I'm sure whatever you decide, your grandmother will appreciate the thought and love behind it.",
