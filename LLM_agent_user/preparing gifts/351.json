These kits often come with materials and instructions for hands-on learning, which would align well with his interest in science.\n\n3. Adventure gear: Consider getting him some outdoor adventure gear like a sturdy backpack, a compass, a headlamp, or a field guide for identifying plants and animals. These items would encourage his love for exploration and nature.\n\n4. Books: Since he enjoys reading about planets and space, you could get him some age-appropriate books on astronomy or space exploration. Look for engaging and visually appealing books that cater to his age group.\n\n5. Construction set: If he enjoys building things, a construction set like LEGO or a building kit for creating models of rockets, spaceships, or famous landmarks could be a great choice. It would allow him to exercise his creativity and problem-solving skills.\n\nRemember, the best gift is one that aligns with his interests and encourages him to explore and learn. I hope these suggestions help you find the perfect gift for your nephew's birthday!",
