Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. Handwritten letter: Write a heartfelt letter expressing your appreciation and how your teacher has made a positive impact on your life. Share specific examples of how they have influenced you and what you have learned from them.\n\n2. Personalized gift: Consider giving a personalized gift that reflects your teacher's interests or hobbies. It could be a book related to their favorite subject, a small piece of artwork, or something they can use in their classroom.\n\n3. Class collaboration: Get your classmates involved and plan a surprise for your teacher. You could create a class photo album, a video montage of memories, or a collaborative artwork showcasing everyone's gratitude.\n\n4. Gift card or voucher: If you're unsure about your teacher's preferences, a gift card or voucher to a bookstore, coffee shop, or a local restaurant can be a great option. It allows them to choose something they'll enjoy.\n\n5. DIY gift: If you enjoy crafting, consider making a handmade gift. It could be a personalized bookmark, a decorative pen holder, or a customized mug. Handmade gifts often have a personal touch that teachers appreciate.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your teacher that you value their hard work and dedication. Whatever you choose, make sure it comes from the heart. Good luck, and I'm sure your teacher will appreciate your thoughtful gesture!",
            "content_zh": "你好！你想在教师节向你的老师表示感激真是太棒了。有许多体贴而有意义的方式来表达你的感激之情。以下是一些建议：\n\n1. 亲笔信：写一封真挚的信表达你的感激之情，以及你的老师是如何对你的生活产生积极影响的。分享具体的例子，说明他们如何影响了你，以及你从他们身上学到了什么。\n\n2. 个性化礼物：考虑送一个反映你老师兴趣或爱好的个性化礼物。可以是一本与他们最喜欢的学科相关的书籍，一件小艺术品，或是他们可以在课堂上使用的东西。\n\n3. 班级合作：让你的同学加入，为老师策划一个惊喜。你们可以制作一本班级相册，一段回忆录视频，或是一个展示每个人感激之情的合作艺术品。\n\n4. 礼品卡或代金券：如果你不确定老师的喜好，送一张书店、咖啡店或本地餐馆的礼品卡或代金券是一个很好的选择。这样可以让他们选择自己喜欢的东西。\n\n5. DIY礼物：如果你喜欢手工制作，考虑制作一件手工礼物。可以是一个个性化书签，一个装饰性笔筒，或是一个自定义马克杯。手工礼物通常有老师欣赏的个人特色。\n\n记住，最重要的是要向老师表示你尊重他们的辛勤工作和奉献精神。无论你选择了什么，确保它是发自内心的。祝你好运，我相信你的老师会欣赏你用心的举动！",
