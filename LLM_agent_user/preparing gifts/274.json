First, it's great that you want to make it special while still being mindful of your budget. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Personalized item: Consider getting something customized with your nephew's name or initials, like a backpack, water bottle, or a piece of jewelry. It adds a personal touch and shows that you put thought into the gift.\n\n2. Hobby-related gift: If your nephew has a specific interest or hobby, consider getting him something related to that. For example, if he enjoys drawing, you could get him a set of high-quality art supplies or a sketchbook.\n\n3. Experience-based gift: Instead of a physical item, you could gift your nephew an experience. It could be tickets to a sporting event, a concert, or a fun day at an amusement park. Creating memories together can be a wonderful gift.\n\n4. Books or educational toys: If your nephew enjoys reading, you could get him a book series he's interested in or a subscription to a kid's book club. Additionally, there are many educational toys available that can be both fun and beneficial for his development.\n\n5. DIY craft kit: Consider a DIY craft kit that allows your nephew to create something on his own. It could be a model kit, a painting set, or even a science experiment kit. These can be engaging and help foster creativity.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose a gift that aligns with your nephew's interests and personality. I hope these suggestions help you find the perfect gift within your budget!",
            "content_zh": "你好！我很乐意帮助你想出一些关于侄子生日礼物的主意。首先，很高兴你想要制作一份特别的礼物，同时也要考虑到你的预算。以下是几个建议：\n\n1. 个性化物品：考虑购买一些定制的物品，上面印有侄子的名字或首字母，比如背包、水壶或珠宝。这会增添个人特色，展示你用心挑选礼物。\n\n2. 与爱好相关的礼物：如果你的侄子有特定的兴趣或爱好，考虑购买与该爱好相关的礼物。例如，如果他喜欢绘画，你可以给他买一套高质量的绘画工具或一个素描本。\n\n3. 基于体验的礼物：你可以送给侄子一次体验，而不是实物礼物。可以是体育赛事的门票、音乐会门票或在游乐园度过的愉快一天。共同创造回忆可以是一份美好的礼物。\n\n4. 书籍或教育玩具：如果你侄子喜欢阅读，可以给他买一套他感兴趣的图书系列或申请一个儿童读书俱乐部。此外，还有许多教育玩具可供选择，既有趣又有益于他的发展。\n\n5. DIY手工艺品套装：考虑一个DIY手工艺品套装，让你的侄子可以自己创造一些东西。可以是一个模型套装、一个绘画套装，甚至是一个科学实验套装。这些套装既能引人入胜，又有助于培养创造力。\n\n记住，最重要的是选择一份符合侄子兴趣和个性的礼物。希望这些建议能帮助你找到在预算内的完美礼物！",
