It's great that you want to make it meaningful while also staying within a reasonable budget. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Personalized photo album: Gather some cherished photos of your grandmother and create a personalized photo album. You can add captions or write short anecdotes alongside the pictures, making it a heartfelt gift that she can look back on.\n\n2. Homemade treats: If your grandmother enjoys homemade goodies, you could bake her favorite cookies, cakes, or other treats. Package them nicely in a decorative box or tin, and include a handwritten note expressing your love and appreciation.\n\n3. Handcrafted item: Consider making something unique by hand, like a knitted scarf, a piece of jewelry, or a painted artwork. Handcrafted gifts often carry sentimental value and show the effort and care you put into creating them.\n\n4. Memory jar: Decorate a jar and fill it with small notes or memories written on colorful paper. These could be moments you've shared together, funny anecdotes, or things you admire about her. It's a lovely way to reminisce and show how much she means to you.\n\n5. Personalized calendar: Design a calendar with family photos, important dates, and personalized messages for each month. This way, she'll have a practical and sentimental gift that she can use throughout the year.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose something that reflects your grandmother's interests, hobbies, or preferences. Consider what she enjoys doing in her free time or any hobbies she has, as this can inspire you to find a gift that she'll truly appreciate.",
