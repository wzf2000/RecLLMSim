This will engage his engineering skills and keep him entertained for hours.\n\n2. Superhero costume: Since he's a fan of superheroes, a superhero costume could be a fantastic gift. It will encourage imaginative play and let him unleash his inner hero. You could even personalize it with his favorite superhero's emblem or name.\n\n3. Art supplies: For his creative side, a set of high-quality art supplies like colored pencils, markers, or paints could be a great choice. Pair it with a sketchbook or coloring book featuring his favorite characters to inspire his artistic endeavors.\n\n4. Science kit: If he enjoys experimenting and exploring, a science kit could be a fantastic gift. Look for kits that allow him to conduct fun and educational experiments, such as creating volcanoes, growing crystals, or making slime.\n\n5. Personalized storybook: Another idea is to create a personalized storybook featuring him as the main character. There are online services that allow you to customize the story, illustrations, and even include his name and picture. It's a unique and memorable gift that he can cherish for years to come.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose something that aligns with his interests and sparks his curiosity.
