Subscription box: Sign him up for a subscription box tailored to his interests, whether it's a grooming kit, a coffee sampler, or a book subscription. It's a gift that keeps on giving throughout the year.\n\n6. Cook a special meal: Prepare his favorite meal at home or try out a new recipe together. Set the mood with candles, soft music, and a beautifully set table.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your thoughtfulness and love.
