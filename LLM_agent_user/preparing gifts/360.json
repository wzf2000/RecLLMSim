These can be both practical and a nod to their love for literature.\n\n3. Handwritten letter or poem: A heartfelt, handwritten letter expressing your gratitude and appreciation can be a very meaningful gift. If you enjoy writing, you could even compose a personalized poem for your teacher, highlighting the impact they've had on your learning journey.\n\n4. Gift card to a bookstore: If you're unsure about specific books or preferences, a gift card to a local bookstore would give your teacher the freedom to choose something they'd enjoy. They can browse and select a book that piques their interest.\n\n5. Classroom supplies: Teachers often need various supplies for their classrooms. Consider gifting them some useful items like colorful pens, sticky notes, or a new whiteboard marker set. These practical gifts can be both thoughtful and helpful.\n\nRemember, it's the thought and effort that count the most.
