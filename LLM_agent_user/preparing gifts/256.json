Here are a few suggestions that are both thoughtful and budget-friendly:\n\n1. Personalized photo album: Compile your favorite memories together in a photo album. You can add captions, stickers, and decorations to make it extra special.\n\n2. DIY coupon book: Create a coupon book filled with personalized vouchers for things like a massage, a home-cooked meal, or a movie night of his choice. It's a fun and thoughtful way to offer experiences rather than material items.\n\n3. Customized playlist or mixed CD: Curate a collection of songs that hold special meaning for both of you. You can create a personalized playlist on a streaming platform or go old school with a mixed CD.\n\n4. Handwritten love letter: Express your feelings through a heartfelt, handwritten letter. Share your favorite memories, what you love about him, and how he has positively impacted your life.\n\n5. Cook his favorite meal: Surprise him with a home-cooked dinner featuring his favorite dishes. Set the mood with candles and soft music for a romantic evening together.\n\n6. Plan a surprise outing: Organize a surprise date or outing based on his interests. It could be a picnic in the park, a hike, a visit to a museum, or any activity he enjoys.\n\n7. DIY jar of love notes: Write down reasons why you love him or sweet messages on small pieces of paper. Fill a jar with these notes, and he can pick one out whenever he needs a little pick-me-up.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your thoughtfulness and love. Tailor the gift to his interests and what he would appreciate the most. Good luck, and I hope you have a wonderful Valentine's Day!",
