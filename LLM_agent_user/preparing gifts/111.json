Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.\n2. In a small bowl, mix together the lemon juice, minced garlic, chopped fresh dill, olive oil, salt, and pepper to create the sauce.\n3. Brush the salmon fillets with the sauce, making sure to coat them evenly.\n4. Place the salmon fillets on the preheated grill and cook for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.\n5. Remove the salmon from the grill and serve it with an extra drizzle of the lemon-dill sauce on top.\n\nYou can pair the grilled salmon with a side of roasted vegetables, such as asparagus or Brussels sprouts, and a healthy grain like quinoa or brown rice. This dish is not only delicious but also provides a good amount of protein and healthy fats from the salmon.\n\nOf course, feel free to adjust the recipe to your grandmother's taste preferences and any dietary restrictions she may have. It's always a good idea to consider her preferences when preparing a special meal.\n\nI hope this suggestion helps, and I wish you success in creating a delightful and nutritious meal for your grandmother!",
