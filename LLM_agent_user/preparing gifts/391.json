It's great that you want to make it special while being mindful of your budget. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Personalized photo album: Gather your favorite memories together and create a personalized photo album. You can include pictures, notes, and little anecdotes that are meaningful to both of you. It's a thoughtful and sentimental gift that he can cherish.\n\n2. Homemade treats: If your boyfriend has a sweet tooth, consider baking his favorite cookies or making a special dessert. Put them in a cute box or jar and decorate it with a heartfelt note. It's a delicious and thoughtful gift made with love.\n\n3. Customized gift: Think about his interests and hobbies. Is there something he's been wanting or needing? You could get him a customized item related to his passion, like a personalized keychain, engraved wallet, or a customized T-shirt. It shows that you pay attention to his interests and want to support them.\n\n4. Plan a surprise date night: Instead of a physical gift, plan a special date night for the two of you. Cook his favorite meal, set up a cozy atmosphere with candles and soft music, and maybe even plan a movie night with his favorite films. Spending quality time together can be a priceless gift.\n\n5. Love coupons: Create a set of love coupons that he can redeem throughout the year. These could include things like a massage, breakfast in bed, a movie night of his choice, or a day without chores. It's a fun and creative way to show your love and offer experiences rather than material gifts.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your love and thoughtfulness. It's the gesture that counts, and I'm sure your boyfriend will appreciate the effort you put into making his Valentine's Day special.",
            "content_zh": "你好！我很高兴能帮助你为男朋友想出一些特别的情人节礼物的主意。很棒的是你想要让它变得特别，同时还要考虑你的预算。以下是一些建议：\n\n1. 个性化相册：收集你们最喜爱的回忆，制作一个个性化的相册。你可以包括照片、便签和有意义的小趣事。这是一份周到而感情深厚的礼物，他会珍藏它。\n\n2. 自制美食：如果你男朋友喜欢吃甜食，考虑烘焙他最喜欢的饼干或制作特别甜点。将它们放在一个可爱的盒子或罐子里，用一张真诚的便签装饰。这是一份用爱心制作的美味而周到的礼物。\n\n3. 定制礼物：考虑他的兴趣和爱好。有没有什么他一直想要或需要的东西？你可以给他买一个定制的跟他热爱相关的物品，比如个性化的钥匙扣、刻字钱包或定制的T恤。这显示出你关注他的兴趣并想要支持他。\n\n4. 策划一个惊喜约会夜：不要送实体礼物，为你们两个策划一个特别的约会夜。为他做他最喜欢的餐点，点起蜡烛，播放柔和的音乐，甚至可以策划一个看他最喜欢的电影的电影之夜。共同度过高质量时间可能是一份无价的礼物。\n\n5. 爱情券：制作一组他可以在全年中兑现的爱情券。这些可以包括按摩、床上享用早餐、他选择的电影之夜，或者一天不用做家务。这是展示你的爱和提供体验而不是物质礼物的有趣创意方式。\n\n记住，最重要的是展现你的爱和体贴。姿态至关重要，我相信你的男朋友会欣赏你为让他的情人节特别而付出的努力。",
