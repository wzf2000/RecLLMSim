Here are a few suggestions that could make her feel special without breaking the bank:\n\n1. Personalized photo album: Collect your favorite pictures together and create a customized photo album. You can add captions, notes, and even decorate the pages with cute stickers or drawings.\n\n2. Handwritten love letter: Take the time to write a heartfelt letter expressing your love and appreciation for her. It's a simple yet incredibly meaningful gesture that shows your thoughtfulness and effort.\n\n3. DIY gift: Consider making something yourself, like a piece of jewelry, a knitted scarf, or a painted canvas. Handmade gifts have a personal touch and can be cherished for years to come.\n\n4. Surprise date night: Plan a romantic evening at home or a special outing tailored to her interests. It could be a candlelit dinner, a picnic in the park, or a movie night under the stars. The key is to create a memorable experience together.\n\n5. Subscription box: Find a subscription box that aligns with her hobbies or interests. Whether it's a monthly book club, a beauty box, or a cooking kit, this gift keeps on giving and shows that you pay attention to her passions.\n\n6. Customized jewelry: Look for personalized jewelry, such as a necklace with her initials or birthstone. It's a timeless gift that she can wear every day and be reminded of your love.\n\nRemember, the most important aspect of a meaningful gift is the thought and effort you put into it. Consider what she loves, her hobbies, and the moments you've shared together, and let that guide you in choosing something special. Good luck, and I hope she loves whatever you decide to give her!",
