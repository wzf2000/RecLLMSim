It could be a necklace with a pendant engraved with both of your initials or birthstones.\n\n5. A day out together: Sometimes the best gift is spending quality time with your loved ones. Plan a day out with your grandmother, taking her to her favorite places or trying something new together. It could be a picnic in the park, a visit to a museum, or a nice meal at her favorite restaurant.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your love and appreciation.
