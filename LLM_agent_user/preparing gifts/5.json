Telescope: Consider getting him a beginner's telescope to explore the night sky. It can be a wonderful way for him to observe celestial objects and nurture his interest in astronomy.\n\n2. Space-themed books: Look for books that delve into space exploration, astronauts, or the wonders of the universe. You can find options suitable for his age, such as \"The Darkest Dark\" by Chris Hadfield or the \"National Geographic Kids Ultimate Space Atlas.\"\n\n3. DIY science kits: There are various science kits available that focus on space-related experiments. These kits often include materials and instructions for creating rockets, exploring the solar system, or conducting simple astronomy experiments. They can be both educational and entertaining.\n\n4. Planetarium projector: A planetarium projector can turn his room into a mini planetarium, projecting images of stars, planets, and constellations onto the ceiling. It can create a captivating and immersive experience for him.\n\n5. Space-themed puzzles or board games: Look for puzzles or board games that revolve around space exploration. They can be a fun way for him to spend time with friends or family while learning more about the universe.\n\nRemember, it's the thought behind the gift that counts the most. Consider his specific interests and hobbies, and choose something that you believe will inspire and engage him.",
