Subscription box: Consider a subscription to a monthly box that delivers age-appropriate STEM projects or building kits. These boxes often provide new and exciting projects to work on each month, keeping his creativity engaged throughout the year.\n\n5. Personalized Lego set: If he's a fan of Legos, you could create a custom Lego set based on his interests. You can find online services that allow you to design and order personalized Lego sets using your own photos or designs.\n\nRemember to consider his skill level and age when choosing a gift, as you want to provide something that will challenge and engage him without being too overwhelming.
