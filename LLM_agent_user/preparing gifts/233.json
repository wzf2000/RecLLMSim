They can choose something they'll enjoy or use for their classroom.\n\n5. Subscription to an educational magazine or online resource: If your teacher has a particular interest, consider gifting them a subscription to a relevant magazine or an online resource that could enhance their professional development.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is the thought behind the gift.
