Teachers play such an important role in our lives, so it's great that you want to show your appreciation. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Handwritten note: A heartfelt and personalized note expressing your gratitude can be a wonderful gift. Share specific examples of how your teacher has made a positive impact on your education and life.\n\n2. Gift cards: If you're unsure about their preferences, a gift card to a bookstore, coffee shop, or restaurant can be a safe choice. It allows them to treat themselves to something they enjoy.\n\n3. Classroom supplies: Teachers often spend their own money on supplies, so practical gifts like pens, markers, notebooks, or classroom decorations can be useful and appreciated.\n\n4. Personalized stationery: Consider getting a customized notepad, sticky notes, or a planner with your teacher's name or initials. It adds a personal touch and can be useful for their daily tasks.\n\n5. Plants or flowers: A potted plant or a bouquet of flowers can brighten up their classroom or workspace. Just make sure to choose low-maintenance plants that are easy to care for.\n\n6. Books: If you know your teacher's interests, gifting a book related to their subject or a novel they might enjoy can be a thoughtful gesture.\n\n7. Handmade crafts: If you're feeling creative, you could make something yourself, like a handmade card, a painting, or a small craft. It shows effort and personalization.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your teacher that you appreciate their hard work and dedication. Whatever gift you choose, it's the thought behind it that truly matters. Good luck with your gift preparation!",
            "content_zh": "你好! 我很乐意帮助你想出一些教师节礼物的主意。老师在我们的生活中扮演着如此重要的角色，所以你想表达感激之情真是太好了。以下是一些建议：\n1. 手写便条：表达感激之情的真挚个性化便条可以是一份美好的礼物。分享具体例子，说明你的老师如何对你的教育和生活产生了积极的影响。\n2. 礼品卡：如果你不确定他们的喜好，可以送一张书店、咖啡店或餐厅的礼品卡。这让他们可以自己选择一些喜欢的东西。\n3. 课堂用品：老师经常花自己的钱购买用品，所以像笔、标记笔、笔记本或课堂装饰等实用的礼物会很有用且受欢迎。\n4. 个性化文具：考虑定制一本便签本、便条贴或计划本，上面印有老师的名字或首字母。这增加了个人风格，对他们日常任务很有用。\n5. 植物或鲜花：一盆植物或一束鲜花可以装点他们的课堂或工作场所。只要确保选择易打理的植物。\n6. 书籍：如果你了解老师的兴趣，送一本与他们学科相关的书籍或一本可能让他们喜欢的小说会是一个体贴的举动。\n7. 手工艺品：如果你有创造力，可以自己制作一些东西，比如手工卡片、绘画或小手工品。这表明了你的努力和个性化。\n记住，最重要的是要向老师表达你对他们辛勤工作和奉献的感激之情。无论你选择什么样的礼物，背后的心意才是真正重要的。祝你的礼物准备一切顺利！",
