Here are a few ideas that could cater to his curiosity, creativity, and love for both indoor and outdoor activities:\n\n1. Science kit: Consider a science experiment kit that allows him to explore and learn about various scientific concepts in a hands-on way. There are many options available, such as chemistry sets, crystal growing kits, or even a DIY electronics kit.\n\n2. Building set: Look for a construction set that allows him to build and create. Building blocks, LEGO sets, or even a robotic kit can provide hours of fun and learning.\n\n3. Outdoor adventure gear: Since he enjoys biking and hiking, you could consider getting him some outdoor gear like a new bike helmet, a compass, a sturdy backpack, or a nature exploration kit with binoculars, a magnifying glass, and a field guide.\n\n4. Art supplies: For his artistic side, you could put together a gift basket of high-quality art supplies like sketchbooks, colored pencils, paintbrushes, and paints. You could also consider a subscription to an art box service that delivers new art projects and supplies each month.\n\n5. DIY project: If you're feeling extra creative, you could prepare a DIY project specifically tailored to his interests. For example, you could create a personalized science experiment kit with instructions and materials for him to explore at home.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose a gift that aligns with his interests and passions. I hope these ideas help you find the perfect gift for your nephew's birthday!",

DIY项目：如果您感到额外有创意，您可以准备一个特别针对他兴趣的DIY项目。例如，您可以创建一个个性化的科学实验套装，包含指导书和材料，让他在家里探索。\n\n记住，选择与他的兴趣和热情相符的礼物是最重要的。希望这些想法能帮助您找到您侄子生日的完美礼物！",
