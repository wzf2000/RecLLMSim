Look for one that aligns with his interests, whether it's building structures, vehicles, or even robots. This will satisfy his love for building things and allow him to exercise his creativity.\n\n4. Adventure book or movie: Find a thrilling adventure book or a movie that matches his age and interests. It could be a story about explorers, treasure hunters, or even a science fiction adventure. This way, he can immerse himself in exciting stories during his free time.\n\n5. Video game or console: If he enjoys playing video games, consider getting him a new game or even a gaming console if you're looking for a bigger gift.
