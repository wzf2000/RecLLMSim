Handwritten note: Sometimes, a heartfelt message can mean the world to a teacher. Take the time to write a sincere letter expressing your appreciation for their guidance and support.\n\n2. Personalized stationery: Consider getting your teacher a set of personalized notepads or sticky notes with their name or initials. It's a practical gift that shows thoughtfulness.\n\n3. DIY gift: Get creative and make something yourself. It could be a handmade card, a small craft, or even a photo collage showcasing memorable moments from the school year.\n\n4. Gift card: If you're unsure of your teacher's preferences, a gift card to a local bookstore, coffee shop, or office supply store can be a versatile and useful present.\n\n5. Classroom supplies: Teachers often spend their own money on supplies. Consider gifting them some essential classroom items like colorful markers, sticky notes, or a new set of pens.\n\n6. Book donation: If you know your teacher's favorite genre or author, consider donating a book to their classroom library. It's a thoughtful gesture that can benefit future students as well.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your appreciation and thoughtfulness. Your teacher will appreciate any gift that comes from the heart. Good luck with your preparations!",

DIY礼物：发挥创意自己制作一些东西。可以是一张手工制作的卡片，一个小手工艺品，甚至是一张展示整个学年中难忘时刻的照片拼贴。4.礼品卡：如果您不确定老师的喜好，一张当地书店、咖啡店或办公用品店的礼品卡是多功能且实用的礼物。5.教室用品：老师通常会花自己的钱买用品。考虑送给他们一些必备的教室用品，如彩色标记笔、便利贴或一套新的钢笔。 6.书籍捐赠：如果您知道老师喜欢的流派或作者，请考虑向他们的教室图书馆捐赠一本书。这是一个体贴的举动，也可以造福未来的学生。请记住，最重要的是表达您的感激和体贴。您的老师会欣然接受任何来自内心的礼物。祝您准备工作顺利！",
