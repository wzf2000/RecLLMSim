Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Personalized item: Consider getting something personalized, like a customized t-shirt, mug, or keychain with his name or a design he likes. It adds a personal touch without breaking the bank.\n\n2. Books: If your nephew enjoys reading, a good book can be a fantastic gift. You can choose a popular series or a book from a genre he's interested in. You could also include a handwritten note explaining why you think he'll enjoy it.\n\n3. Experience or activity: Instead of a physical gift, you could plan an experience or activity that he would enjoy. It could be a trip to a local amusement park, a mini-golf outing, or even a movie night at home with his favorite snacks.\n\n4. DIY project: Consider making something yourself. It could be a homemade card, a scrapbook with memories, or even a simple craft project that he would find interesting. Handmade gifts often hold sentimental value and show your effort and thoughtfulness.\n\n5. Subscription box: There are many subscription boxes available for kids that offer age-appropriate activities, books, or toys delivered monthly. It's a gift that keeps on giving, and you can choose a subscription within your budget.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose something that reflects your nephew's interests and shows that you put thought into the gift. I hope these ideas help, and I'm here if you need more suggestions!",
            "content_zh": "你好！我很乐意帮助你为侄子的生日礼物想出一些主意。你希望能让礼物特别，但又要考虑预算，这是很棒的。以下是一些建议： 1. 个性化物品：考虑购买一些个性化的东西，比如定制T恤，杯子或者钥匙扣，上面可以印他的名字或他喜欢的设计。这样可以增加个人感，又不会花太多钱。 2. 书籍：如果侄子喜欢阅读，一本好书可以是一份很棒的礼物。你可以选择一个受欢迎的系列或者他有兴趣的类别的书。你也可以写一张手写便条解释你为什么认为他会喜欢这本书。 3. 体验或活动：可以计划一次他会喜欢的体验或活动，而不是实物礼物。比如去当地游乐园，迷你高尔夫之旅，或者在家里放一场电影夜，准备他最喜欢的零食。 4. 自制项目：考虑亲手制作一些东西。可以是一张手工卡片，一个装满回忆的剪贴簿，甚至一个他会觉得有趣的简单手工项目。手工礼物通常具有感情价值，展示出你的用心和体贴。 5. 订阅盒：有很多专为儿童设计的订阅盒，每月提供适合各年龄的活动，书籍或玩具。这是一份源源不断的礼物，你可以选择一个符合你预算的订阅。 记住，最重要的是选择能反映侄子兴趣并显示出你用心挑选礼物的东西。希望这些建议能帮到你，如果需要更多建议，记得告诉我！",
