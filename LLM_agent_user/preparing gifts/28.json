Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Personalized photo album: Gather memorable pictures of your nephew and create a photo album or scrapbook. You can include captions, stickers, and decorations to make it extra special.\n\n2. DIY craft kit: If your nephew enjoys arts and crafts, put together a DIY craft kit with various materials and instructions. It could be something like painting, origami, or even making friendship bracelets.\n\n3. Book or magazine subscription: If your nephew loves reading, consider getting him a book or a subscription to a magazine that aligns with his interests. It's a gift that keeps on giving throughout the year.\n\n4. Outdoor adventure kit: Put together a kit with small items like a compass, flashlight, magnifying glass, and a nature journal. This encourages your nephew to explore the outdoors and have fun adventures.\n\n5. Movie night package: Create a movie night package by including his favorite snacks, popcorn, and a DVD or a gift card for streaming services. It's a great way to have a cozy night in.\n\n6. Sports equipment: If your nephew enjoys sports, consider getting him a small piece of sports equipment like a basketball, soccer ball, or a frisbee. It encourages him to stay active and have fun outdoors.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is that the gift comes from the heart. It's the thought and effort you put into it that make it special, not necessarily the price tag. I hope these ideas help, and I'm sure your nephew will appreciate whatever you decide to give him!",
