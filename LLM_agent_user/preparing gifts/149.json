Here are a few suggestions that might inspire you:\n\n1. Personalized items: Consider getting something customized with his name or initials, like a monogrammed wallet, engraved keychain, or personalized photo frame.\n\n2. DIY gifts: Handmade gifts can be incredibly meaningful. You could create a scrapbook of your memories together, make a handwritten love letter, or even bake his favorite treats.\n\n3. Experiences: Instead of a physical gift, plan a special date or outing. It could be a surprise weekend getaway, tickets to a concert or sports event he enjoys, or a reservation at his favorite restaurant.\n\n4. Subscription box: If your boyfriend has specific interests, consider a subscription box tailored to his hobbies. Whether he's into gaming, cooking, or fitness, there are subscription services that deliver monthly surprises related to his interests.\n\n5. Thoughtful accessories: Look for accessories that align with his style or hobbies. It could be a stylish watch, a trendy tie or pocket square, a new gadget, or even a book by his favorite author.\n\nRemember, the most important aspect is to choose a gift that reflects his interests, shows your love and thoughtfulness, and reminds him of the special bond you share. Good luck with your gift search!",

DIY礼物：手工制作的礼物可以非常有意义。你可以制作一个记录你们共同回忆的剪贴簿，写一封手写的情书，甚至烘焙他最喜欢的点心。\n\n3. 体验：与其送物质礼物，不如计划一个特别的约会或外出活动。可以是一个惊喜周末旅行，他喜欢的音乐会或体育赛事的门票，或者在他最爱的餐厅预订。\n\n4. 订阅盒：如果你的男朋友有特定的兴趣，考虑一个根据他的爱好定制的订阅盒。无论他对游戏、烹饪还是健身感兴趣，都有提供每月惊喜的订阅服务。\n\n5. 贴心配饰：寻找与他的风格或爱好相符的配饰。可以是时尚的手表、潮流的领带或口袋巾、新奇的小玩意，甚至是他最喜欢的作者的书。\n\n记住，最重要的是选择一个能反映他的兴趣、展现你的爱和用心，并提醒他你们特别关系的礼物。祝你找礼物顺利！",
