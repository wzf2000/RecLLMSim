Handmade gifts: If you're artistically inclined, consider creating something handmade, like a painting, a piece of pottery, or a personalized card expressing your appreciation.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose a gift that reflects your gratitude and thoughtfulness. It's the gesture that matters most. Good luck with your gift search, and I'm sure your professor will appreciate whatever you decide to give!",
