Here are a few suggestions that might help:\n\n1. Personalized thank-you notes: A heartfelt, handwritten note expressing your gratitude can be a meaningful gift. You can also consider adding a small gift card or token alongside it.\n\n2. Books: If your teacher loves reading, a book related to their subject or a topic they enjoy could be a great choice. You can even write a special message inside the cover to make it more personal.\n\n3. DIY gifts: Handmade gifts can be incredibly special. You could consider creating a personalized photo frame, a decorative bookmark, or even a customized pen holder. Get creative and think about what your teacher might appreciate.\n\n4. Classroom supplies: Teachers often spend their own money on classroom supplies. Consider getting them some items they frequently use, such as colorful markers, sticky notes, or a new whiteboard marker set.\n\n5. Gift cards: If you're unsure about their preferences, a gift card to a bookstore, coffee shop, or a stationery store could be a safe and practical choice.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is the thought and effort you put into the gift. Reflect on what your teacher likes and what would make them feel appreciated. I'm sure they'll be grateful for whatever you choose!",
            "content_zh": "你好！在教师节表达对老师的感激是一个很棒的主意。选择合适的礼物可以是一种体贴的举动。以下是一些建议，可能会有所帮助： 1. 个性化的感谢卡：一张真诚的手写卡表达感激之情可以是一份有意义的礼物。您还可以考虑在礼卡旁边添加一张小礼品卡或代币。 2. 书籍：如果您的老师喜欢阅读，选择一个与他们学科相关或他们喜欢的话题相关的书可能是一个不错的选择。您甚至可以在书封内写下特别的消息，让礼物更具个人特色。 3. 手工制作礼物：手工礼物可以非常特别。您可以考虑制作一个个性化的相框、一个装饰性书签，甚至一个定制的笔筒。发挥创意，考虑一下您的老师可能会喜欢什么。 4. 教室用品：教师通常会为购买教室用品花费自己的钱。考虑为他们购买一些他们经常使用的物品，如彩色记号笔、便笺或新的白板记号笔套装。 5. 礼品卡：如果您不确定他们的喜好，那么书店、咖啡店或文具店的礼品卡可能是一个安全实用的选择。 记住，最重要的是您为礼物投入的心思和努力。深思熟虑您的老师喜欢什么，以及什么会让他们感到被重视。我相信无论您选择什么，他们都会心怀感激。",
