There are various kits available, such as chemistry sets, electronics kits, or even robotics kits, which can provide hands-on learning experiences.\n\n2. Building Sets: Consider construction sets like LEGO Technic or other building kits that allow him to assemble and create his own gadgets, structures, or vehicles. These sets can enhance his problem-solving skills and encourage his creativity.\n\n3. Art Supplies: Since he enjoys drawing and painting, you could get him a set of high-quality art supplies, such as sketchbooks, paints, brushes, or markers. You might also consider art kits that provide instructions for specific projects or techniques.\n\n4. Coding Games: There are several coding games and toys available that can introduce him to the world of programming in a fun and interactive way. Look for options like board games or coding robots that teach basic coding concepts.\n\n5. Virtual Reality (VR) Headsets: If you're looking to splurge a bit, a VR headset could be an exciting gift. It can offer immersive experiences and educational games related to science, technology, and creativity.\n\nRemember to consider his age and skill level when selecting a gift. It's also a good idea to check reviews and ratings to ensure you're choosing a quality product. I hope these suggestions help, and I'm sure your nephew will appreciate whatever thoughtful gift you decide to give him!",
