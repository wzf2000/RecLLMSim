Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Handwritten note: A heartfelt message expressing your gratitude and the impact your teacher has had on you can be a meaningful gift.\n\n2. Personalized items: Consider personalized stationery, a custom-made mug, or a keychain with your teacher's initials or a special message.\n\n3. Gift cards: If you're unsure about your teacher's preferences, a gift card to a bookstore, coffee shop, or restaurant can be a versatile and thoughtful option.\n\n4. Classroom supplies: Teachers often spend their own money on supplies, so gifting items like colorful markers, sticky notes, or a nice planner can be practical and appreciated.\n\n5. Books: If you know your teacher's interests, a book related to their subject or a novel they might enjoy can be a great choice.\n\n6. Plants or flowers: A small potted plant or a bouquet of flowers can brighten up your teacher's workspace and show your appreciation.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose a gift that reflects your gratitude and thoughtfulness. Good luck, and I'm sure your teacher will appreciate whatever you decide to give!",
