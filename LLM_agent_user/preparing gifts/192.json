You could create a handmade card, write a heartfelt letter expressing your gratitude, or even make a small craft or artwork. Personalized gifts like these often have a special touch that can be cherished for years to come.\n\nUltimately, the most important thing is to show your teacher that you appreciate their hard work and dedication.
