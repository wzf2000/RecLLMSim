You could plan a surprise visit to their classroom, coordinate with your classmates to create a special moment, or even organize a small celebration with your teacher's permission.\n\n5.

A sincere thank-you note or a conversation about how they've impacted your life can make the gift even more meaningful.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your teacher that you genuinely appreciate their hard work and dedication.
