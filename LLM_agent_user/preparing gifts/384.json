Here are a few suggestions that are thoughtful and within a moderate price range:\n\n1. Personalized stationery: Consider getting your teacher a set of personalized note cards, a customized pen, or a stylish notebook. It's a practical gift that they can use and appreciate.\n\n2. Gift cards: A gift card to a bookstore, coffee shop, or a restaurant can be a great option. It allows your teacher to choose something they enjoy or have a relaxing experience.\n\n3. Homemade treats: If you have culinary skills, you could bake some homemade cookies, brownies, or a cake for your teacher. It adds a personal touch and shows effort and thoughtfulness.\n\n4. Plants or flowers: A small potted plant or a bouquet of flowers can brighten up your teacher's workspace. It's a simple yet thoughtful gift that brings a touch of nature indoors.\n\n5. Handwritten letter or card: Sometimes, heartfelt words can mean the most. Write a sincere letter expressing your gratitude and admiration for your teacher's guidance and support.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is the sentiment behind the gift. Choose something that reflects your appreciation and shows that you've put thought into it. I hope these ideas help, and I wish you a successful Teacher's Day celebration!",
