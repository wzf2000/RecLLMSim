LEGO Superhero Set: Consider getting him a LEGO set that features his favorite superhero, Spider-Man. There are various sets available, ranging from Spider-Man's hideouts to iconic scenes from the movies. This way, he can enjoy building and playing with his favorite superhero at the same time.\n\n2. LEGO Technic Set: If he enjoys a more challenging building experience, you could go for a LEGO Technic set. These sets offer more intricate building designs and often include motorized functions. There are even Technic sets that feature vehicles or machines related to superheroes, such as the Spider-Man Spider-Cycle Chase.\n\n3. Customized LEGO Minifigure: Another unique idea is to create a custom LEGO minifigure of your nephew as a superhero. There are online services that allow you to personalize minifigures with customized outfits, accessories, and even facial expressions. It's a fun and personalized gift that he can cherish.\n\n4. Superhero Building Blocks Set: In addition to LEGO, there are other building block sets available that feature superheroes. These sets often come with compatible pieces that allow for creative building and imaginative play. Look for sets that include superhero-themed characters, vehicles, and buildings.\n\n5. Superhero-themed Building Challenge: Create a superhero-themed building challenge for your nephew. Gather a variety of building materials, such as LEGO bricks, cardboard, and craft supplies. Provide him with a task or a storyline, like building a superhero headquarters or designing a new gadget. This interactive and creative experience can be a lot of fun for him.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose something that aligns with his interests and brings him joy. I hope these suggestions help you find the perfect gift for your nephew's birthday!",
