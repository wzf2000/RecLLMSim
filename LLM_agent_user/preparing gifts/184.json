Here are a few ideas that might inspire you:\n\n1. Handwritten letter: Take the time to write a heartfelt letter expressing your gratitude and how your teacher has positively impacted your life. Personalized messages are always meaningful and cherished.\n\n2. Gift cards: Consider getting a gift card for your teacher's favorite coffee shop, bookstore, or restaurant. This allows them to treat themselves and enjoy some well-deserved relaxation.\n\n3. Classroom supplies: Teachers often spend their own money on classroom supplies, so gifting them some useful items like pens, notebooks, or even a nice planner can be practical and appreciated.\n\n4. Book or educational material: If you know your teacher's interests or hobbies, you could gift them a book related to that topic. Alternatively, educational materials or resources that align with their teaching area could also be a great choice.\n\n5. Personalized keepsake: A personalized gift, such as a custom-made keychain, mug, or a photo frame with a picture of you and your teacher, can be a lovely reminder of your time together.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose something that reflects your gratitude and shows that you've put thought into the gift. Good luck with your Teacher's Day gift preparation!",
            "content_zh": "你好！你想要表达对老师的感激之情真是太棒了。一份用心的礼物能让你的感恩之情表达得更深刻。这里有一些可能会给你灵感的想法：\n1.手写感谢信：花些时间写一封发自内心的感谢信，表达你的感激以及老师对你生活的积极影响。个性化的信息总是有意义的且珍贵。\n2.礼品卡：考虑给老师喜欢的咖啡店、书店或餐厅购买礼品卡。这样可以让他们自我奖励并享受一些应得的休息。\n3.教室用品：老师们经常花自己的钱购买教室用品，所以送他们一些有用的物品如笔、笔记本，甚至是一个精美的计划本都是实用且会受到赞赏的。\n4.书籍或教育材料：如果你了解老师的兴趣或爱好，你可以赠送他们一本相关主题的书籍。或者，与他们教学领域相关的教育材料或资源也是一个很好的选择。\n5.个性化纪念品：个性化的礼物，比如定制的钥匙链、杯子，或者一款带有你和老师照片的相框，可以成为你们相处时光的美好回忆。\n记住，最重要的是选择能反映你的感激之情并表明你用心考虑了这份礼物。祝你准备教师节礼物好运！",
