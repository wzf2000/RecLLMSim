Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. Personalized photo album: Collect your favorite photos together and create a handmade photo album or scrapbook. Add captions or little notes to make it even more special.\n\n2. DIY gift basket: Put together a themed gift basket tailored to his interests. Fill it with items like his favorite snacks, a movie or book he's been wanting, or small items related to his hobbies.\n\n3. Customized playlist: Create a playlist of songs that hold special meaning for both of you. You can use a streaming platform or burn it onto a CD for a nostalgic touch.\n\n4. Homemade treats: If you enjoy baking or cooking, make his favorite dessert or prepare a romantic candlelit dinner at home. The effort and personal touch will surely be appreciated.\n\n5. Love coupons: Create a set of homemade love coupons that he can redeem for things like a massage, a movie night of his choice, breakfast in bed, or a day of pampering.\n\n6. Memory jar: Decorate a jar and fill it with small notes, each containing a happy memory or something you love about him. He can pick one out each day and be reminded of your love.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your thoughtfulness and love. It's the little gestures that often mean the most. I hope these ideas inspire you, and I'm here if you need any more suggestions!",
