Handwritten note: A heartfelt, personalized note expressing your gratitude and appreciation can be incredibly meaningful. Share specific examples of how your teacher has made a positive impact on you.\n\n2. DIY gift: Get creative and make something yourself. You could create a customized bookmark, a decorative pen holder, or even a small photo album with memorable moments from the school year.\n\n3. Classroom supplies: Teachers often spend their own money on classroom supplies. Consider gifting some essential items like colored pens, sticky notes, or a nice notepad. It's practical and shows that you value their work.\n\n4. Gift card: If you're unsure of your teacher's preferences, a gift card to a bookstore, coffee shop, or office supply store can be a safe and useful option. They can choose something they'll enjoy or use in their personal or professional life.\n\n5. Plants: A small potted plant can brighten up any classroom. Choose a low-maintenance plant like a succulent or a small herb that your teacher can easily care for. It's a thoughtful and long-lasting gift.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your appreciation and thoughtfulness. It's the gesture that matters the most, so don't worry too much about the cost. Good luck with your gift preparations!",
            "content_zh": "你好！我很乐意帮助你为教师节为你的老师想出一些特别又经济实惠的礼物主意。以下是一些建议： 1. 手写便签：一张真诚、个性化的便签表达你的感激和欣赏可能是非常有意义的。分享你老师如何对你产生积极影响的具体例子。 2. DIY礼物：发挥创意，自制一些东西。你可以制作一个定制的书签、一个装饰性的笔筒，甚至一本装有学年中难忘时刻的小相册。 3. 教室用品：老师们经常在教室用品上花自己的钱。考虑送一些必需品，如彩色笔、便条纸或精美的记事本。实用且显示你重视他们的工作。 4. 礼品卡：如果你不确定老师的喜好，送他一张书店、咖啡店或办公用品店的礼品卡可能是一个安全实用的选择。他们可以选择自己喜欢的东西，在个人或职业生活中使用。 5. 植物：一盆小盆栽可以给任何教室增添光彩。选择一个易打理的植物，如多肉植物或一颗小香草，你的老师可以轻松地照料。这是一份体贴又持久的礼物。 记住，最重要的是表达你的感激和体贴。最重要的是这种举动，所以不要太担心成本。祝你准备礼物顺利！",
