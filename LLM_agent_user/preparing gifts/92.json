Handwritten note: A heartfelt message expressing your gratitude and appreciation can be incredibly meaningful. Take the time to reflect on how your teacher has impacted your life and share those thoughts with them.\n\n2. DIY gift: Get creative and make something yourself. It could be a personalized bookmark, a small potted plant, or a decorated photo frame with a picture of your class. Handmade gifts often carry a lot of sentimental value.\n\n3. Class collaboration: Get your classmates involved and create a collective gift. You could compile a class photo album, create a video montage with messages from each student, or put together a scrapbook highlighting memorable moments from the school year.\n\n4. Book or stationery: If your teacher enjoys reading, consider getting them a book related to their interests or a genre they enjoy. Alternatively, a set of nice stationery such as colorful pens, sticky notes, or a personalized notebook can also be a thoughtful gift.\n\n5. Gift cards: While it may seem impersonal to some, gift cards can be a practical and appreciated gift. Consider getting a gift card to a local bookstore, coffee shop, or a store where they can purchase school supplies.\n\nRemember, the most important aspect of any gift is the thought and effort behind it. Choose something that reflects your teacher's interests and shows your appreciation for their hard work. Good luck, and I'm sure your teacher will appreciate whatever you decide to give them!",
            "content_zh": "你好！我很乐意帮助你想出一些体贴且价格合理的礼物想法给你的老师。以下是一些建议：\n\n1. 手写便条：一份表达感激和欣赏之情的真挚信息可以非常有意义。花时间反思你的老师如何影响了你的生活，并与他们分享这些想法。\n\n2. DIY礼物：发挥创意，亲手制作一些东西。可以是个性化的书签，一个小盆栲植物，或者带有你们班照片的装饰相框。手工制作的礼物通常具有很高的感情价值。\n\n3. 班级合作：让你的同学参与并创作一份集体礼物。你们可以编辑一本班级相册，制作一段包含每位学生留言的视频剪辑，或者制作一本突出学年中难忘时刻的剪贴簿。\n\n4. 书籍或文具：如果你的老师喜欢阅读，可以考虑为他们选择一本与他们兴趣相关的书籍或他们喜欢的类型。或者，一套漂亮的文具，如色彩缤纷的笔、便条纸或个性化笔记本也可以是一份体贴的礼物。\n\n5. 礼品卡：虽然对一些人来说可能显得不够个性化，但礼品卡是一份实用且受欢迎的礼物。考虑给他们一张本地书店、咖啡店或可以购买学习用品的商店的礼品卡。\n\n记住，任何礼物最重要的是背后的用心和努力。选择反映你老师兴趣并表现出你对他们辛勤工作的感激的东西。祝你好运，我相信你的老师会对你决定送给他们的任何礼物表示欣赏！",
