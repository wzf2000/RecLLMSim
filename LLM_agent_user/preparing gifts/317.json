Basketball gear: Consider getting him a basketball, a basketball hoop for his backyard, or even a basketball jersey of his favorite team or player. This would be perfect for his love of sports and playing with his friends.\n\n2. Video games: If he enjoys video games, you could consider getting him a popular sports video game like NBA 2K or a multiplayer game that he can enjoy with his friends. Just make sure to check if he already has the game or if there's a specific one he's been eyeing.\n\n3. Sports equipment: Along with basketball, he might enjoy trying out other sports too. You could get him equipment for a different sport, like a soccer ball, a baseball glove, or a football. This would encourage him to explore and play different games.\n\n4. Party games: Since he enjoys spending time with friends at parties, you could consider getting him some fun party games like a mini basketball hoop for indoor play, a ping pong set, or a bean bag toss game. These games can provide hours of entertainment and friendly competition.\n\n5. Sports-themed room decor: To enhance his love for sports, you could gift him some sports-themed room decor, such as posters, wall decals, or bedding featuring his favorite sports teams or athletes.\n\nRemember, the best gift is one that shows you've put thought into his interests and hobbies. I hope these suggestions help you find the perfect gift for your nephew's birthday!",
