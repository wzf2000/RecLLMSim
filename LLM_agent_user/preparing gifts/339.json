Let's brainstorm some options together!\n\nFirst, it's important to consider your nephew's interests and hobbies. What does he enjoy doing? Is he into sports, art, music, or anything specific? Knowing his preferences can help narrow down the options.\n\nIf he's into sports, you could consider getting him a new sports equipment, such as a basketball, soccer ball, or a skateboard. These are often reasonably priced and can provide hours of fun.\n\nIf he's artistic, you might want to consider art supplies like a sketchbook, colored pencils, or paints. These can be affordable and encourage his creativity.\n\nAnother option could be a book or a series that he might enjoy reading. Books are usually available in a wide range of prices and can be a great way to inspire imagination and learning.\n\nIf you have some DIY skills, you could try making a personalized gift. For example, you could create a scrapbook filled with memories and photos, or even make a custom T-shirt with his favorite character or design.\n\nRemember, the thought and effort you put into the gift are often more important than the price tag. It's the sentiment behind it that truly matters.\n\nI hope these ideas help you get started. Let me know if you need more suggestions or have any specific details in mind!",
            "content_zh": "你好！很高兴能帮助你为侄子的生日想礼物。考虑到预算并制作特别礼物是很好的。让我们一起头脑风暴一些选择吧！首先，重要的是要考虑侄子的兴趣和爱好。他喜欢做什么？他喜欢运动、艺术、音乐或者其他什么？了解他的喜好可以帮助缩小选项。如果他喜欢运动，你可以考虑给他买一些新的运动装备，比如篮球、足球或者滑板。这些通常价格合理且可以提供几个小时的乐趣。如果他喜欢艺术，你可以考虑艺术用品，比如素描本、彩色铅笔或颜料。这些既可以负担得起又可以激发他的创造力。另一个选择可能是一本他可能喜欢阅读的书籍或系列。书籍通常有各种价格范围，可以是激发想象力和学习的好方法。如果你有一些DIY技能，你可以尝试制作一个个性化的礼物。例如，你可以制作一个充满回忆和照片的剪贴簿，或者制作一件带有他最喜欢的角色或设计的定制T恤。记住，你投入到礼物中的心意和努力往往比价格标签更重要。真正重要的是其中所表达的情感。希望这些想法能帮助你开始。如果你需要更多建议或有任何具体要求，请告诉我！",
