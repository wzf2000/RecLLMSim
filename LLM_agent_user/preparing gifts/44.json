DIY gift: Consider making a handmade gift like a bookmark, a photo frame, or a personalized keychain. You can find many simple DIY tutorials online that are easy to follow.\n\n4. Classroom supplies: Teachers often spend their own money on classroom supplies. Consider gifting your teacher some essential items they may need, such as colorful markers, sticky notes, or a nice pen set.\n\n5. Gift card or book: If you're unsure about your teacher's preferences, a gift card to a bookstore or a popular online retailer could be a great option. Alternatively, you can choose a book that aligns with their interests or subject they teach.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your appreciation and thoughtfulness. Whatever you choose, your teacher will surely appreciate the effort and sentiment behind the gift. Good luck, and I hope your teacher has a fantastic Teacher's Day!",
