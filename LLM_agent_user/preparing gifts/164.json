Gift cards: If you're unsure of your teacher's preferences, a gift card to a bookstore, coffee shop, or a local restaurant can be a versatile and thoughtful choice.\n\n4. Classroom supplies: Teachers often spend their own money on supplies, so consider gifting some useful items like colorful pens, sticky notes, or a new whiteboard marker set.\n\n5. Plants or flowers: A potted plant or a bouquet of flowers can bring some cheer to your teacher's desk and brighten up their day.\n\n6. Books: If you know your teacher's interests, you could gift them a book related to their subject or a novel they might enjoy.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your appreciation and thoughtfulness. Choose a gift that reflects your teacher's personality and interests, and I'm sure they'll appreciate the gesture. Good luck with your gift preparations!",
