DIY spa or relaxation kit: Put together a collection of items that promote relaxation, such as scented candles, bath salts, a cozy blanket, or a book she might enjoy. It's a perfect gift to help her unwind and take some time for herself.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is the thought and effort you put into the gift.
