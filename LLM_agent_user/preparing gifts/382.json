Handwritten note: Sometimes, the simplest gestures can mean the most. Write a heartfelt note expressing your gratitude and appreciation for your teacher's guidance and support. It's a personal touch that won't cost you much but will be cherished.\n\n2. Homemade treats: If you enjoy baking or cooking, consider making some homemade goodies like cookies, brownies, or a jar of homemade jam. It shows effort and thoughtfulness while being budget-friendly.\n\n3. Personalized stationery: Teachers often use stationery, so consider getting them a personalized notepad, a set of pens, or even a custom-made bookmark. It's a practical gift that can be used daily, and the personalization adds a special touch.\n\n4. Classroom supplies: Teachers often spend their own money on classroom supplies, so consider gifting them some useful items. It could be a set of colorful markers, sticky notes, or even a pack of nice pens. Practical gifts like these can be appreciated and put to good use.\n\n5. Gift cards: If you're unsure about what your teacher might like, a gift card to a bookstore, coffee shop, or office supply store is a safe option. It allows them to choose something they genuinely need or enjoy.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is the thought and effort you put into the gift. It's the gesture and appreciation that counts, so don't stress too much about the cost. I'm sure your teacher will appreciate whatever you choose!",
            "content_zh": "你好！很高兴能帮助你想出一些贴心又物美价廉的礼物给你的老师。以下是一些建议：1.手写便条：有时候，最简单的举动意义最深远。写一张发自内心的便条，表达你对老师指导和支持的感激和赞赏。这是一种个人化的小细节，花费不多但会被珍视。2.自制美食：如果你喜欢烘焙或烹饪，考虑制作一些自制点心，比如饼干、布朗尼或一罐自制果酱。既显示出努力和体贴，又经济实惠。3.个性化文具：老师经常使用文具，所以考虑为他们购买一本个性化记事本、一套钢笔，甚至一个定制的书签。这是一份实用的礼物，可以每天使用，而且个性化增添了特别的味道。4.教室用品：老师常常用自己的钱购买教室用品，所以考虑送给他们一些有用的物品。可以是一套彩色记号笔、便签纸，甚至一盒优质钢笔。这类实用礼物会受到赞赏并被好好利用。5.礼品卡：如果你不确定老师喜欢什么，那么送一张书店、咖啡店或办公用品店的礼品卡是个安全选择。这样可以让他们选择他们真正需要或喜欢的东西。请记住，最重要的是你为礼物付出的心思和努力。所以不要过于担心成本。我相信你的老师会欣赏你选择的任何礼物！",

Purchase blank cards or notepaper and use your artistic skills to decorate them with drawings, calligraphy, or even printed photos. This adds an extra personal touch to the gift.\n\nWhen it comes to the design, consider something professional and elegant. Classic designs like monograms or simple patterns can work well for a teacher. You could also choose stationery with motivational quotes or educational-themed illustrations.

This could be a collection of handwritten notes or a class photo with personalized messages from each student. It shows unity and appreciation from the entire class.\n\n3. Create a memory jar: Find a decorative jar and fill it with small notes or memories from the class. Each student can write a note about a memorable moment, a favorite lesson, or something they appreciate about the teacher. It's a heartfelt and meaningful gift that your teacher can cherish for years to come.\n\n4. Plan a surprise celebration: Coordinate with your classmates and plan a surprise celebration for your teacher on Teacher's Day.
