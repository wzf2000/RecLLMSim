Whether it's a monthly book subscription, a grooming kit, or a snack box, it's a gift that keeps on giving throughout the year.\n\n4. DIY gift: Put your creative skills to use and make a gift yourself. It could be a heartfelt handwritten letter, a scrapbook of your memories together, or a jar filled with love notes or reasons why you appreciate him.\n\n5. Thoughtful gesture: Sometimes, it's the small gestures that mean the most. Cook his favorite meal, plan a cozy movie night at home, or surprise him with breakfast in bed. Showing your love and care through actions can make the day extra special.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose something that reflects his interests, preferences, and the unique bond you share.
