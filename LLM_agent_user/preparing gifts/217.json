Personalized stationary: Teachers often appreciate practical gifts, and personalized stationary can be a thoughtful and useful option. You could consider getting a notebook, pen set, or a customized planner with their name or initials.\n\n2. Gift cards: If you're unsure about their preferences, a gift card to a bookstore, coffee shop, or a teacher supply store can be a versatile choice. This way, they can choose something they truly enjoy or find useful.\n\n3. Handwritten note or card: Sometimes, heartfelt words can mean more than any material gift. Take the time to write a sincere note expressing your gratitude and appreciation for their hard work and dedication.\n\n4. Classroom supplies: Teachers often spend their own money on classroom supplies, so gifting items like colorful markers, sticky notes, or educational posters can be practical and helpful.\n\n5. Book or educational material: If you know your teacher's interests, consider gifting a book related to their subject or a resource they can use to enhance their teaching methods. It shows that you value their passion for education.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is the thought behind the gift. Choose something that reflects your teacher's personality and interests, and they're sure to appreciate the gesture.",
