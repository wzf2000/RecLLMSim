It's wonderful that you want to make it special while also being mindful of your budget. Here are a few ideas to get you started:\n\n1. Personalized photo album: Gather some cherished family photos and create a customized photo album for your grandmother. You can add captions, notes, and even decorate the pages to make it extra special.\n\n2. Homemade treats: If your grandmother enjoys homemade goodies, consider baking her favorite cookies, cakes, or other treats. You can package them beautifully and add a heartfelt note to make it even more meaningful.\n\n3. Handwritten letter or card: Sometimes the simplest gestures can have the most significant impact. Write a heartfelt letter or card expressing your love and gratitude for your grandmother. She'll surely appreciate the thought and effort you put into it.\n\n4. DIY crafts: If you're feeling creative, consider making a handmade craft for your grandmother. It could be a knitted scarf, a painted picture frame, or a personalized piece of jewelry. The possibilities are endless, and it will show her how much you care.\n\n5. Plant or flowers: A plant or a bouquet of her favorite flowers can be a lovely gift. Not only will it brighten up her space, but it also symbolizes growth and life, making it a meaningful present.\n\n6. Spa or relaxation items: Treat your grandmother to some relaxation by putting together a small spa package. Include items like scented candles, bath salts, a cozy robe, or even a massage voucher if it fits within your budget.\n\nRemember, the most important aspect of any gift is the thought and love behind it. Choose something that resonates with your grandmother's interests, hobbies, or preferences, and I'm sure she'll appreciate it. Good luck, and I hope you find the perfect gift for your grandmother!",
