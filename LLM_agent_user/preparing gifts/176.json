Lego sets: Since he enjoys playing with Legos, you could consider getting him a new Lego set that aligns with his interests. There are various themes available, like space exploration, architecture, or even specific movie franchises. It's a great way for him to continue building and exploring his creativity.\n\n2. STEM kits: To nurture his interest in science and experiments, you could gift him a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) kit. These kits often come with materials and instructions for engaging experiments or projects. Look for ones that focus on topics like robotics, chemistry, or engineering.\n\n3. Building sets: Apart from Legos, there are other building sets available that can challenge his creativity. For example, magnetic building blocks, marble run sets, or even a set of gears and pulleys. These can help him explore different engineering concepts while having fun constructing unique structures.\n\n4. Art supplies: Encourage his artistic side by gifting him a set of art supplies. It could be a sketchbook, colored pencils, watercolors, or even a DIY art kit. This way, he can explore different art techniques and express his creativity beyond building.\n\nRemember, it's not just about the gift itself, but also the thought and effort you put into it. Personalize the gift by considering his specific interests and hobbies, and I'm sure he'll appreciate it.",
