Given your friends' preferences for hearty and grilled dishes, I have a suggestion for a delicious and satisfying meal: Grilled Lemon Herb Chicken with Roasted Vegetables and Garlic Mashed Potatoes. It's a classic combination that is sure to impress your friends. Here's a breakdown of the recipe and the necessary ingredients:\n\nGrilled Lemon Herb Chicken:\n- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n- 2 lemons\n- 3 tablespoons olive oil\n- 2 cloves of garlic, minced\n- 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped\n- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme, chopped\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n\nRoasted Vegetables:\n- Assorted vegetables of your choice (e.g., bell peppers, zucchini, eggplant, onions)\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n\nGarlic Mashed Potatoes:\n- 4 large potatoes, peeled and quartered\n- 4 cloves of garlic, minced\n- 1/4 cup butter\n- 1/2 cup milk (or more if needed)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n\nFor the chicken, start by marinating it. In a bowl, combine the juice of 1 lemon, olive oil, minced garlic, parsley, thyme, salt, and pepper. Add the chicken breasts and let them marinate for at least 30 minutes (or overnight if you have time). Then, preheat your grill and cook the chicken for about 6-8 minutes per side, or until cooked through.\n\nFor the roasted vegetables, preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Cut the vegetables into bite-sized pieces and place them on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and toss to coat. Roast in the oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until they are tender and slightly browned.\n\nFor the garlic mashed potatoes, boil the potatoes in salted water until they are fork-tender. Drain the water and return the potatoes to the pot. Add the minced garlic, butter, milk, salt, and pepper. Mash everything together until smooth and creamy. Adjust the consistency with more milk if needed.\n\nOnce everything is cooked, serve the grilled lemon herb chicken alongside the roasted vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes. You can garnish the chicken with slices of the remaining lemon for an extra touch of freshness.\n\nI hope this recipe and meal idea will be a hit with your friends! Let me know if you need any further assistance or if you have any other questions.",
