It's easy to prepare and combines the sweetness of watermelon with the saltiness of feta cheese. Add some fresh mint leaves and a drizzle of balsamic glaze for an extra touch.\n\nMain Course: For the main course, let's go with a crowd-pleaser like Herb-Roasted Chicken with Roasted Vegetables. Season the chicken with a blend of herbs like rosemary, thyme, and garlic, then roast it in the oven until it's juicy and tender. Accompany it with a colorful medley of roasted vegetables like potatoes, carrots, and Brussels sprouts.\n\nDessert: Finish the meal with a delightful dessert like a Classic Crème Brûlée. This creamy custard dessert with a caramelized sugar crust is sure to impress your friends. You'll need some ramekins, eggs, cream, sugar, and a kitchen torch to achieve that crispy caramelized top.\n\nThese dishes strike a balance between elegance and approachability. They also allow you to showcase different cooking techniques while keeping the preparation manageable. Let me know if you'd like detailed recipes or if you have any other preferences!",
