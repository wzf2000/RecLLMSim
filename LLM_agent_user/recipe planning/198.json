Then bake until golden and cooked through.\n- Roasted Vegetables: Toss a medley of your favorite vegetables (such as carrots, bell peppers, zucchini, and onions) with olive oil, salt, and pepper, then roast in the oven until tender.\n\nSide Dish:\n- Creamy Mashed Potatoes: Boil potatoes until tender, then mash them with butter, milk, salt, and pepper until smooth and creamy.\n\nDessert:\n- Apple Crisp: Toss sliced apples with sugar, cinnamon, and a squeeze of lemon juice. Place them in a baking dish and top with a mixture of oats, flour, brown sugar, and butter. Bake until the apples are tender and the topping is golden and crisp. Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.\n\nThese dishes are relatively simple to prepare and should be enjoyable for your friends.
