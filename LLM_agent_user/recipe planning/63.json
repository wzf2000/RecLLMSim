Using an immersion blender or regular blender, puree the soup until smooth.\n5. Return the soup to the pot, add the heavy cream, and season with salt and pepper.\n6. Simmer for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n7.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the sugar, eggs, and egg yolks until well combined.\n4. Pour the melted chocolate mixture into the sugar and egg mixture, whisking until smooth.\n5. Sift in the flour and salt, and gently fold until just combined.\n6. Divide the batter equally among the prepared ramekins.\n7.
