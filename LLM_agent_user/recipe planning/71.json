            "content": "I'm glad you like the menu! Let's dive into the details for each dish:\n\nCaprese Salad: For the tomatoes, I recommend using ripe and juicy vine-ripened tomatoes or heirloom tomatoes for the best flavor. As for the mozzarella cheese, fresh buffalo mozzarella or mozzarella di bufala would be ideal. It has a creamy texture and mild flavor that pairs well with the tomatoes and basil.\n\nTo enhance the flavors, you can drizzle some extra virgin olive oil over the salad and sprinkle a pinch of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. This will add a touch of richness and seasoning to the dish.\n\nHerb-Crusted Rack of Lamb: To prepare the lamb, you can create a marinade using finely chopped fresh herbs like rosemary, thyme, and garlic. Mix them with olive oil, salt, and pepper, then rub the mixture all over the rack of lamb. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.\n\nFor cooking the lamb, start by searing it in a hot pan with some oil to get a nice crust. Then transfer it to a preheated oven and roast it until it reaches your desired level of doneness. For medium-rare, it usually takes around 15-20 minutes at 400°F (200°C). However, cooking times may vary depending on the size of the rack and your oven, so it's always a good idea to use a meat thermometer to ensure it's cooked to your liking.\n\nAs for the roasted vegetables, you can choose a medley of your favorites like carrots, asparagus, and cherry tomatoes. Toss them with olive oil, salt, and pepper, then roast them in the oven alongside the lamb until they're tender and slightly caramelized.\n\nFor the mashed potatoes, you can boil peeled and cubed potatoes until they're soft. Drain them, then mash them with butter, warm milk or cream, salt, and pepper until smooth and creamy. Adjust the consistency to your liking by adding more milk if needed.\n\nChocolate Lava Cake: To achieve the perfect gooey center, it's important not to overbake the cake. The edges should be set, but the center should still be slightly jiggly. Bake the cakes in individual ramekins or molds and keep a close eye on them while they're in the oven. It usually takes around 10-12 minutes at 425°F (220°C), but again, it may vary depending on your oven, so it's best to do a toothpick test to check for the desired consistency.\n\nFor plating and garnishing, you can dust the cakes with powdered sugar, add a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream on the side, and garnish with fresh berries or a sprig of mint for a pop of color.\n\nI hope these details help you create a memorable meal! Let me know if you have any more questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.",
            "content_zh": "很高兴您喜欢菜单！让我们深入了解每道菜的细节：\n\n卡普雷塞沙拉：对于番茄，我建议使用成熟多汁的葡萄熟番茄或传统番茄以获得最佳风味。至于马苏里拉奶酪，新鲜的水牛马苏里拉或意大利水牛奶酪会是理想之选。它有奶油般的口感和温和的味道，与番茄和罗勒搭配得很好。\n\n为了提升风味，您可以在沙拉上淋上一些特级初榨橄榄油，撒上一点海盐和新鲜研磨的黑胡椒。这将为这道菜增添丰富的味道和调味。\n\n草药焗羊排：为了准备羊排，您可以用新鲜切碎的草药如迷迭香、百里香和大蒜制作腌料。将它们与橄榄油、盐和胡椒混合，然后涂抹在整个羊排上。让其腌制至少30分钟以使味道渗透到肉里。\n\n烹制羊排时，首先在热锅中用一些油煎炸，以获得一个漂亮的外壳。然后将其转移到预热的烤箱中，烤至达到您理想的熟度。对于五分熟，通常需要在华氏400度（摄氏200度）下烤约15-20分钟。然而，烹饪时间可能会因羊排的大小和您的烤箱而有所不同，因此最好使用肉温计以确保烹饪到您的口感。\n\n至于烤蔬菜，您可以选择您喜欢的胡萝卜、芦笋和樱桃番茄混合。将它们与橄榄油、盐和胡椒拌匀，然后与羊排一起烤至它们变软且略微焦糖化。\n\n对于土豆泥，您可以将削皮和切块的土豆煮至软。沥干后，用黄油、温牛奶或奶油、盐和胡椒捣碎直至光滑和奶油状。根据您的喜好添加更多牛奶来调整口感。\n\n巧克力熔岩蛋糕：要实现完美的熔岩中心，不要过度烘烤蛋糕很重要。边缘应该凝固，但中心仍然略带颤动。将蛋糕烘烤在个别的烤盘或模具中，并在烤箱中密切留意它们。通常在425华氏度（220摄氏度）下烤约10-12分钟，但这可能会因您的烤箱而有所不同，因此最好使用牙签测试以检查所需的口感。\n\n用盘子装盘并点缀，您可以在蛋糕上撒上糖粉，加一勺香草冰淇淋或一勺打发的奶油，并用新鲜莓果或一小束薄荷装饰以增添色彩。\n\n希望这些细节可以帮助您创造一个难忘的晚餐！如果您有任何问题或需要我帮助的地方，请随时告诉我。",
