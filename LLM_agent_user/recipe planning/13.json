Greek Salad:\n- Recipe: You can find a classic Greek salad recipe on various cooking websites or in Mediterranean cookbooks. It typically includes ingredients like tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, Kalamata olives, feta cheese, olive oil, lemon juice, and oregano.\n- Tip: To enhance the flavors, make sure to use ripe and juicy tomatoes, high-quality feta cheese, and extra-virgin olive oil.\n\n2. Spanakopita:\n- Recipe: There are many variations of spanakopita, but a common recipe involves sautéing spinach, onions, and garlic, then mixing them with feta cheese and herbs like dill or parsley. The mixture is then wrapped in phyllo pastry and baked until golden and crispy.\n- Tip: Be sure to squeeze out any excess moisture from the spinach before mixing it with the other ingredients to prevent a soggy filling.\n\n3. Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken:\n- Recipe: Start by marinating chicken pieces in a mixture of lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and herbs such as thyme, rosemary, and oregano. Let it marinate for a few hours or overnight, then roast in the oven until cooked through and golden brown.\n- Tip: Basting the chicken with the marinade while roasting will help keep it moist and flavorful.\n\n4. Stuffed Bell Peppers:\n- Recipe: Prepare a filling by combining cooked couscous, roasted vegetables (like zucchini, eggplant, and bell peppers), feta cheese, herbs, and seasonings. Stuff the mixture into halved bell peppers and bake until the peppers are tender and the filling is heated through.\n- Tip: Pre-roasting the bell peppers for a few minutes before stuffing them will help soften them and reduce the overall baking time.\n\nWhen it comes to the order of preparation, here's a suggested timeline:\n1. Preparing the Greek Salad and Tzatziki can be done a few hours before the meal, as they can be served chilled.\n2. Baklava can be made a day or two in advance, as it actually tastes better when it has had time to sit and allow the flavors to meld.\n3. Start marinating the chicken a few hours before cooking, allowing it to absorb the flavors.\n4. While the chicken is roasting, prepare the Spanakopita filling and assemble the dish. Bake it just before serving.\n5. Lastly, prepare the Stuffed Bell Peppers and Roasted Mediterranean Vegetables as the chicken is resting.\n\nRemember to plan your cooking schedule based on the oven and stovetop space you have available. I hope these recipes and tips help you create a memorable birthday feast! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Enjoy your celebration!",
            "content_zh": "非常欢迎！我很高兴你喜欢菜单。我很乐意为你提供我提到的菜品的一些具体食谱和建议。以下是：\n\n1. 希腊沙拉：\n- 食谱：你可以在各种烹饪网站或地中海烹饪书中找到经典希腊沙拉食谱。通常包括番茄、黄瓜、红洋葱、卡拉马塔橄榄、菲达奶酪、橄榄油、柠檬汁和牛至等配料。\n- 提示：为了增强口味，确保使用熟透多汁的番茄、高质量的菲达奶酪和特级初榨橄榄油。\n\n2. 西班牙菠菜派：\n- 食谱：西班牙菠菜派有许多变种，但一个常见的食谱是先炒菠菜、洋葱和大蒜，然后与菲达奶酪和莳萝或欧芹等香草混合。然后将混合物包裹在菲洛酥皮中，烤至金黄酥脆。\n- 提示：确保挤出菠菜中多余的水分，以防止填料变软。\n\n3. 柠檬香草烤鸡：\n- 食谱：先将鸡块 marinate 在柠檬汁、橄榄油、大蒜和百里香、迷迭香和牛至等香草混合物中。让其腌制几小时或隔夜，然后在烤箱中烤至熟透金黄。\n- 提示：烤鸡时用腌料刷润会帮助保持鸡肉湿润多汁。\n\n4. 烤灌胡椒：\n- 食谱：通过混合熟品小米、烤蔬菜（如西葫芦、茄子和甜椒）、菲达奶酪、香草和调味料来制备填料。将混合物填入切开的甜椒中，烤至椒子变软，内馅热透。\n- 提示：在填料前将灌胡椒预先烤数分钟有助于软化及减少整体烘烤时间。\n\n在准备顺序方面，这里有一个建议的时间轴：\n1. 准备希腊沙拉和Tzatziki可以在餐前几个小时完成，因为它们可以冷冻食用。\n2. 香甜甜品可以提前一两天制作，因为经过静置和融合口味后味道会更好。\n3. 在烹制前几个小时开始腌制鸡肉，以便吸收香料。\n4. 当鸡肉在烘烤时，准备西班牙菠菜派的馅料并组装菜品。在上菜前烤熟。\n5. 最后，当鸡肉休息时，准备灌胡椒和烤地中海蔬菜。\n\n请记得根据你有的烤箱和灶台空间计划烹饪进程。我希望这些食谱和建议能帮助你打造一个难忘的生日盛宴！如果你有更多问题或需要进一步帮助，请随时问。祝你庆祝快乐！",
