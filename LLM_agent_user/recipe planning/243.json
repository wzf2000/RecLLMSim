            "content": "Grilling steaks sounds like a fantastic choice for your birthday celebration! It's a classic and crowd-pleasing option. Let's create a menu that complements the steaks with flavorful sides and a delightful dessert.\n\nFor the main dish, juicy steaks, here's a simple recipe to follow:\n\nIngredients:\n- 10 high-quality steaks (choose your preferred cut, such as ribeye, New York strip, or filet mignon)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Olive oil\n\nInstructions:\n1. Preheat your grill to high heat.\n2. Take the steaks out of the refrigerator and let them come to room temperature for about 30 minutes.\n3. Season the steaks generously with salt and pepper on both sides.\n4. Drizzle a bit of olive oil over the steaks and rub it in to ensure they don't stick to the grill.\n5. Place the steaks on the preheated grill and cook them to your desired level of doneness. For medium-rare, grill them for about 4-5 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the steaks.\n6. Once cooked, remove the steaks from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes before serving.\n\nNow, let's move on to the sides. Here are a few ideas that complement grilled steaks well:\n\n1. Grilled Vegetables:\n- Ingredients: Assorted vegetables (such as bell peppers, zucchini, eggplant, and mushrooms), olive oil, salt, and pepper.\n- Instructions: Cut the vegetables into bite-sized pieces, toss them with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Grill them until tender and slightly charred.\n\n2. Baked Potatoes:\n- Ingredients: Russet potatoes, olive oil, salt, and optional toppings like sour cream, chives, and bacon bits.\n- Instructions: Scrub the potatoes clean, rub them with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt. Wrap each potato in aluminum foil and grill them for about 45-60 minutes, or until tender. Serve with your choice of toppings.\n\n3. Grilled Corn on the Cob:\n- Ingredients: Fresh corn on the cob, butter, salt, and optional herbs like parsley or cilantro.\n- Instructions: Peel back the husks of the corn, remove the silk, and then fold the husks back over the corn. Soak the corn in water for about 10 minutes. Grill the corn, turning occasionally, for about 15-20 minutes or until the kernels are tender. Serve with butter and a sprinkle of salt and herbs.\n\nFor dessert, how about a classic choice like grilled peaches with vanilla ice cream?\n\nGrilled Peaches with Vanilla Ice Cream:\n- Ingredients: Ripe peaches, honey, cinnamon, vanilla ice cream.\n- Instructions: Cut the peaches in half and remove the pits. Brush each peach half with honey and sprinkle with a pinch of cinnamon. Grill them for about 2-3 minutes per side until they are slightly softened and have grill marks. Serve them warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.\n\nThat should make for a delicious and memorable birthday celebration! Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.",
            "content_zh": "烤牛排听起来像是一个绝妙的生日庆典选择！这是一个经典且受欢迎的选项。让我们打造一个与牛排搭配美味配菜和令人愉悦的甜点的菜单。\n\n作为主菜，多汁的牛排，这里有一个简单的食谱：\n\n材料：\n- 10块优质牛排（选择您喜欢的部位，如肋眼牛排、纽约西冷牛排或菲力牛排）\n- 适量盐和胡椒\n- 橄榄油\n\n指导：\n1. 将烧烤架预热至高温。\n2. 将牛排从冰箱里取出，让它们室温约30分钟。\n3. 在两面上将牛排大量撒上盐和胡椒。\n4. 微泼一点橄榄油在牛排上，擦一下确保它们不会粘在烧烤架上。\n5. 将牛排放在预热的烧烤架上，按照您喜欢的熟度煮熟。对于五分熟，每面煮约4-5分钟，取决于牛排的厚度。\n6. 煮好后，将牛排从烧烤架上取出，让它们休息几分钟后上菜。\n\n现在，让我们转向配菜。以下是几个与烤牛排搭配得很好的想法：\n\n1. 烤蔬菜：\n- 材料：各种蔬菜（如甜椒、西葫芦、茄子和蘑菇）、橄榄油、盐和胡椒。\n- 指导：将蔬菜切成一口大小的块，用橄榄油、盐和胡椒拌匀。烤至变软并带点焦糖。\n\n2. 烤土豆：\n- 材料：土豆，橄榄油，盐，可选的配料如酸奶油、细香葱和培根丁。\n- 指导：擦干净土豆，抹上橄榄油，撒上盐。将每个土豆用铝箔包裹，烤约45-60分钟，或者直到变软。搭配您喜欢的配料上菜。\n\n3. 烤玉米棒：\n- 材料：新鲜玉米棒，黄油，盐，可选的香料如香菜或香菜。\n- 指导：剥开玉米叶，去除玉米须，然后将叶子折回玉米上。将玉米浸泡在水中约10分钟。翻转玉米，烤约15-20分钟或者玉米粒变软。搭配黄油、少许盐和香料上菜。\n\n甜点方面，试试经典选择——烤桃配香草冰淇淋如何？\n\n烤桃配香草冰淇淋：\n- 材料：成熟桃子、蜂蜜、肉桂、香草冰淇淋。\n- 指导：将桃子切成两半，去掉核。每个桃子半刷上蜂蜜，撒上一点肉桂。烤约2-3分钟每面直到稍软并有烤痕。温热搭配一勺香草冰淇淋上桌。\n\n这应该会是一个美味且难忘的生日庆典！请告诉我如果需要我帮忙的其他事情。",
