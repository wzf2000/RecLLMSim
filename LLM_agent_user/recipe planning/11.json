Here's a recipe for you:\n\nGrilled Steak with Garlic Butter:\nIngredients:\n- 2 ribeye or sirloin steaks (about 1 inch thick)\n- Salt and pepper, to taste\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped\n\nInstructions:\n1. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.\n2. Season the steaks generously with salt and pepper on both sides. Drizzle them with olive oil and rub it in to ensure even coating.\n3. Place the steaks on the grill and cook for about 4-5 minutes per side for medium-rare, or adjust the cooking time to your desired level of doneness.\n4. While the steaks are grilling, prepare the garlic butter. In a small bowl, mix the softened butter, minced garlic, and chopped parsley until well combined.\n5. Once the steaks are done, remove them from the grill and allow them to rest for a few minutes.\n6. Place a dollop of the garlic butter on top of each steak and let it melt over the hot meat.\n7. Serve the steaks with your choice of sides, such as roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a fresh salad.\n\nThis recipe should give you a delicious and flavorful grilled steak. Feel free to adjust the seasonings and cooking time to your preference. And if you have any questions along the way, just let me know!",
