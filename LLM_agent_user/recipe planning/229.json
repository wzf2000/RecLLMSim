Slice the baguette or Italian bread and toast it in the oven or on a grill. Meanwhile, dice the ripe tomatoes and chop the fresh basil. Mix them with minced garlic, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper. Once the bread is toasted, top it with the tomato mixture.\n\n2. Move on to the main course, chicken piccata. Pound the chicken breasts to an even thickness, then dredge them in flour seasoned with salt and pepper. Sauté the chicken in a combination of butter and olive oil until golden brown. Remove the chicken from the pan and make the piccata sauce by adding garlic, lemon juice, capers, and chicken broth to the pan. Simmer until the sauce thickens slightly, then return the chicken to the pan to heat through.\n\n3. Lastly, prepare the tiramisu. Begin by brewing strong coffee or espresso and letting it cool. In a mixing bowl, beat together the mascarpone cheese, eggs, and sugar until smooth. Dip the ladyfingers into the cooled coffee or espresso and layer them in a dish. Spread a layer of the mascarpone mixture on top, then repeat the layers. Finish with a dusting of cocoa powder and, if desired, dark chocolate shavings.\n\nBy following this order, you can have the bruschetta ready as an appetizer, then move on to the main course while the flavors meld. Finally, you can assemble the tiramisu and let it chill in the refrigerator while you enjoy the rest of the meal.",
            "content_zh": "非常欢迎！我很高兴菜单符合您的喜好。至于准备顺序，这里有一个建议的时间表：\n1. 首先准备意式开胃面包片。切片法棍面包或意大利面包，然后在烤箱或烤架上烤至金黄。同时，切碎成熟的番茄和新鲜罗勒。将它们与切碎的大蒜、橄榄油、意大利香醋、盐和胡椒混合在一起。当面包烤好后，将番茄混合物放在上面。\n2. 接着是主菜，柠檬白汁鸡肉。将鸡胸肉敲薄，然后裹上调过盐和胡椒的面粉。在黄油和橄榄油的组合中煎炸鸡肉，直至金黄色。将鸡肉从锅中取出，然后在锅中加入大蒜、柠檬汁、橄榄、酸豆和鸡汤制成白汁。煮至酱汁稍微浓稠，然后将鸡肉放回锅中加热。\n3. 最后准备提拉米苏。首先冲一杯浓咖啡或浓缩咖啡并待凉。在一个搅拌碗中，将马斯卡彭奶酪、鸡蛋和糖搅打至顺滑。将手指饼干浸入冷却的咖啡中，然后在盘子里铺排。在上面抹一层马斯卡彭混合物，然后重复层叠。最后撒一层可可粉和（如果需要的话）黑巧克力碎片。\n按照这个顺序，您可以先准备开胃菜意式面包片，然后转到主菜，以便风味融合。最后，您可以组装提拉米苏并且在您享用剩下的菜肴时让其冷藏。",
