Here's a suggestion for a delicious and diverse menu:\n\nAppetizer: Let's start with a refreshing and flavorful appetizer like bruschetta. You can top toasted baguette slices with a combination of diced tomatoes, fresh basil, garlic, olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper.\n\nSoup or Salad: For the next course, you could serve a light and vibrant salad or a comforting soup. A classic Caesar salad with homemade dressing and croutons is always a hit. Alternatively, a creamy tomato basil soup with a side of crusty bread would be equally delightful.\n\nMain Course: How about preparing a hearty dish like a lemon garlic roasted chicken? Marinate the chicken in a mixture of lemon juice, garlic, herbs, and olive oil, then roast it in the oven until it's juicy and golden brown. Serve it with a side of roasted vegetables or mashed potatoes.\n\nVegetarian/Vegan Option: It's always a good idea to have a vegetarian or vegan option. You could make a flavorful vegetable stir-fry with tofu or a delicious pasta dish with roasted vegetables and a creamy sauce made from cashews.\n\nDessert: Finish off the meal with a sweet treat like a homemade fruit tart or a decadent chocolate mousse. Both options are relatively easy to make and are sure to impress your guests.\n\nDon't forget to pair the meal with some refreshing beverages like a fruity sangria, sparkling water with fresh herbs and citrus, or a selection of wines if you and your friends enjoy them.\n\nI hope this menu gives you some inspiration! Let me know if you need any specific recipes or further assistance with the ingredients or cooking techniques.",
            "content_zh": "听到这个消息很棒！没有饮食限制，我们有很多选择。我们考虑计划一顿多道菜的餐，让聚会更加特别怎么样？以下是一份美味多样的菜单建议：\n\n前菜：让我们从清新美味的开胃菜bruschetta开始吧。你可以在烤面包片上撒上切碎的番茄、新鲜罗勒、大蒜、橄榄油，再撒上盐和胡椒。\n\n汤或沙拉：接下来的一道菜可以是清淡可口的沙拉或舒心的汤。经典的凯撒沙拉配上自制的调味汁和面包块总是受欢迎的选择。另外，配上一块脆皮面包的奶油番茄罗勒汤也让人非常愉悦。\n\n主菜：为什么不准备一道像柠檬大蒜烤鸡这样的丰盛菜品呢？将鸡肉用柠檬汁、大蒜、香料和橄榄油腌制后放进烤箱中烤制至鲜嫩金黄，再配上烤蔬菜或土豆泥。\n\n素食/纯素选项：拥有素食或纯素选项总是一个不错的选择。你可以制作一道美味的蔬菜炒或者搭配烤蔬菜和用腰果制成的奶油酱的意面。\n\n甜点：用一道自制水果挞或一份浓缩巧克力慕斯作为餐食的结束。这两个选择都相对容易制作，一定会让你的客人印象深刻。\n\n不要忘记与餐食搭配一些清爽的饮料，比如果味桑格利亚、搭配新鲜香草和柑橘的气泡水，或者如果你和朋友们喜欢的话，还可以提供一些葡萄酒。\n\n希望这份菜单为你带来一些灵感！如果需要具体的食谱，或者对原料或烹饪技术需要进一步帮助，请告诉我。",
