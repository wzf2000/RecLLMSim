It's a collection of small dishes such as hummus, tzatziki, olives, stuffed grape leaves, and pita bread. It's a great way to introduce your friends to different flavors and textures.\n\nFor dessert, you can keep it simple with a refreshing fruit salad or go for a traditional Mediterranean dessert like baklava if you're feeling adventurous.\n\nDoes this sound like something you'd be interested in?
