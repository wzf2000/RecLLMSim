Carrots, potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and even bell peppers or zucchini work well. Choose a variety of vegetables that you enjoy or that complement the flavors of the main course. Just make sure to cut them into similar-sized pieces for even cooking.\n\nNow, let's talk about wine pairings! For the appetizer, a crisp white wine like Sauvignon Blanc or a light-bodied red like Pinot Noir would be a good choice. These wines will complement the fresh flavors of the bruschetta. \n\nFor the main course, since we're roasting chicken with herbs, you can go for a medium-bodied red wine like Merlot or a Chardonnay if you prefer white wine. Both options will pair nicely with the flavors of the chicken and the roasted vegetables.\n\nLastly, for the chocolate lava cake, you can't go wrong with a sweet dessert wine like Port or a rich red wine like Cabernet Sauvignon. These wines will enhance the richness of the chocolate and create a delightful pairing.\n\nRemember, these are just suggestions, and you should choose wines that you personally enjoy.

Prepare the herb mixture by combining chopped fresh herbs (such as rosemary and thyme), minced garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Mix everything well.\n\n3.

Toss the vegetables with olive oil, salt, and pepper in a separate bowl.\n\n5. Arrange the vegetables around the chicken in the roasting pan, ensuring they are in a single layer. This allows them to roast evenly.\n\n6. Place the roasting pan in the preheated oven and roast for about 45-60 minutes, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C) and the vegetables are tender and golden brown. Check the chicken's doneness by inserting a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the meat.\n\n7. While the chicken and vegetables are roasting, prepare the mashed potatoes. Peel and dice the potatoes, then boil them in salted water until tender. Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot.\n\n8. Mash the potatoes using a potato masher or a fork. Add butter, salt, pepper, and a splash of milk or cream. Mash and mix until you achieve a smooth and creamy consistency. Adjust the seasonings to taste.\n\n9. Once the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are roasted to perfection, remove them from the oven. Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before carving.\n\n10.
