In a separate bowl, beat the heavy cream until soft peaks form.\n6. In another bowl, whisk the mascarpone cheese until smooth. Fold in the cooled egg yolk mixture and vanilla extract.\n7. Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture until well combined.\n8. In a shallow dish, combine the brewed coffee and rum (if using).\n9. Dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture, making sure to coat both sides without soaking them.\n10. Arrange half of the soaked ladyfingers in a single layer in a serving dish.\n11.
