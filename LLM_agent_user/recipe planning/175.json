            "content": "I'm glad you're excited about the menu! Let's go through the order of preparation and some tips for each dish:\n\n1. Shrimp Satay Skewers with Peanut Sauce:\n   - Start by marinating the shrimp in a mixture of lemongrass, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, and lime juice for about 30 minutes.\n   - While the shrimp marinates, prepare the peanut sauce by combining peanut butter, coconut milk, honey, and a splash of lime juice. Adjust the consistency by adding more coconut milk if needed.\n   - Skewer the marinated shrimp and grill or broil them until cooked through.\n   - Serve the skewers with the peanut sauce and garnish with chopped cilantro.\n\nTip: Soak the skewers in water for about 30 minutes before threading the shrimp to prevent them from burning.\n\n2. Spicy Mexican Tortilla Soup with Avocado Crema:\n   - Begin by sautéing onions, garlic, and jalapeño in a pot until softened. Add diced tomatoes, chicken broth, cumin, and chili powder. Simmer for about 15 minutes.\n   - While the soup simmers, prepare the avocado crema by blending avocado, lime juice, sour cream, and a pinch of salt until smooth.\n   - Add tortilla strips and cooked chicken (if using) to the soup and simmer for a few more minutes.\n   - Serve the soup hot, garnished with a drizzle of avocado crema and fresh cilantro.\n\nTip: For an extra touch, you can fry some tortilla strips for a crispy garnish.\n\n3. Pan-Seared Steak with Chimichurri Sauce and Roasted Potatoes:\n   - Start by seasoning the steak generously with salt and pepper. Heat some oil in a skillet over high heat and sear the steak on both sides until it reaches your desired level of doneness. Let it rest for a few minutes before slicing.\n   - While the steak rests, prepare the chimichurri sauce by blending garlic, fresh herbs (such as parsley and oregano), red wine vinegar, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Slowly drizzle in olive oil until the sauce reaches a smooth consistency.\n   - For the roasted potatoes, toss them with olive oil, salt, and pepper, then roast in the oven until golden and crispy.\n   - Serve the sliced steak with a generous drizzle of chimichurri sauce and a side of roasted potatoes.\n\nTip: Letting the steak rest after cooking allows the juices to redistribute, resulting in a juicier steak.\n\n4. Decadent Chocolate Lava Cakes with Raspberry Coulis:\n   - Preheat your oven and prepare the ramekins by greasing them and dusting with cocoa powder.\n   - Melt the dark chocolate and butter together, then whisk in eggs, sugar, and flour until well combined.\n   - Divide the batter among the ramekins and bake them until the edges are set but the centers are still gooey.\n   - While the cakes cool slightly, prepare the raspberry coulis by blending raspberries and a bit of powdered sugar until smooth.\n   - Serve the warm lava cakes with a drizzle of raspberry coulis and a garnish of fresh mint leaves.\n\nTip: Dust the ramekins with cocoa powder instead of flour to prevent white residue on the cakes.\n\nRemember, timing is key when preparing a multi-course meal. Plan your prep work and cooking schedule accordingly to ensure everything is ready to be served at the right time. And don't forget to have fun while cooking and enjoy the process!",
            "content_zh": "很高兴你对菜单感兴奋！让我们一起来看看准备顺序和每道菜的一些建议：\n1. 花生酱虾肉沙嗲串：\n- 首先，将虾肉用柠檬草、姜、大蒜、酱油和酸柑汁混合腌制约30分钟。\n- 在虾肉腌制的同时，准备花生酱，将花生酱、椰奶、蜂蜜和一点酸柑汁混合。如有必要，可加入更多椰奶调节稠度。\n- 将腌制的虾肉串起来，烤或烤至熟。\n- 与花生酱一起上桌，并撒上切碎的香菜。\n提示：将串烤签在水中浸泡30分钟，以防止烤焦。\n2. 辣墨西哥玉米片汤配鳄梨奶油酱：\n- 先在锅中炒洋葱、大蒜和墨西哥辣椒，直到软化。加入切碎的番茄、鸡汤、孜然和辣椒粉。炖约15分钟。\n- 汤在炖的时候，制作鳄梨奶油酱，将鳄梨、酸柑汁、酸奶油和一点盐搅拌至顺滑。\n- 将玉米片和已煮熟的鸡肉（如有）加入汤中，再炖几分钟。\n- 热汤上桌，浇上一点鳄梨奶油酱和新鲜香菜。\n提示：为了增添风味，您可以炸些玉米片做脆皮装饰。\n3. 干煎牛排配奇米苏酱和烤土豆：\n- 先用盐和胡椒腌制牛排。在煎锅里加热一些油，高温两面干煎牛排，直至达到您所期望的熟度。切片前让其静置片刻。\n- 牛排静置时，用大蒜、新鲜香草（如欧芹和牛至）、红酒醋、红辣椒粉、盐和胡椒混合制作奇米苏酱。缓慢地加入橄榄油，直至酱汁达到顺滑的稠度。\n- 对于烤土豆，用橄榄油、盐和胡椒拌匀，然后在烤箱中烤至金黄、脆脆。\n- 上桌的烤土豆搭配大量的奇米苏酱和烤土豆。\n提示：煮熟的牛排静置后，汁液重新分布，使牛排更多汁。\n4. 浓情巧克力熔岩蛋糕配覆盆子酱：\n- 预热烤箱，并将烤模抹油并撒上可可粉。\n- 将黑巧克力和黄油一起融化，然后搅拌融入鸡蛋、糖和面粉至混合均匀。\n- 将面糊分配到烤模中，并烤至边缘凝固但中心仍然松软。\n- 在蛋糕稍冷时，用覆盆子和少许糖粉混合搅拌成覆盆子酱。\n- 上桌时将温热的熔岩蛋糕拌上覆盆子酱和新鲜薄荷叶。\n提示：用可可粉将烤模抹油，以防蛋糕上有白色残渣。记住，在准备多道菜时，时机至关重要。计划好准备工作和烹饪时间表，以确保一切能准时上桌。别忘了在烹饪时享受，尽情享受整个过程！",
