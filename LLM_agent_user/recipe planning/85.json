It's a well-balanced dish that combines protein, healthy fats, and fiber.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the recipe:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).\n\n2. Start by preparing the salmon fillet. Place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Season it with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice. You can also add some herbs like dill or parsley for extra flavor.\n\n3. Next, let's prepare the roasted vegetables. Choose your favorites, such as carrots, broccoli, and bell peppers. Wash and chop them into bite-sized pieces. Toss them in a bowl with olive oil, salt, pepper, and any other desired seasonings, like garlic powder or paprika.\n\n4. Spread the seasoned vegetables on a separate baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n\n5. Place both the salmon and the vegetable trays in the preheated oven. Bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and the vegetables are tender and slightly caramelized.\n\n6. While the salmon and vegetables are baking, let's prepare the quinoa. Rinse 1 cup of quinoa under cold water to remove any bitterness. In a saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa with 2 cups of water or vegetable broth. Bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes or until the quinoa is fluffy and the liquid is absorbed.\n\n7. Once everything is cooked, remove the salmon and vegetables from the oven. Serve the baked salmon fillet on a plate alongside the roasted vegetables and a scoop of quinoa.\n\nAnd there you have it—a delicious and healthy meal! Feel free to customize the recipe by adding your favorite herbs, spices, or additional side dishes. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance along the way!",
