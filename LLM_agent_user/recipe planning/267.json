In a bowl, combine the minced garlic, lemon zest, lime zest, lemon juice, lime juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Mix well to create the marinade.\n2. Thread the shrimp onto skewers, making sure to leave enough space between each piece.\n3. Place the shrimp skewers in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over them, ensuring they are well coated. Let them marinate in the refrigerator for about 20-30 minutes.\n4. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Grill the shrimp skewers for 2-3 minutes per side, until they turn pink and opaque.\n5. Remove the skewers from the grill and serve them as a delicious appetizer.\n\nPan-Seared Salmon with Lemon Butter Sauce:\n1. Season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper on both sides.\n2. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the butter. Allow it to melt and start bubbling.\n3. Carefully place the salmon fillets in the skillet, skin-side down if they have skin. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.\n4. Remove the salmon from the skillet and set it aside on a plate.\n5. In the same skillet, add the lemon juice and stir it into the remaining butter to create a sauce. Cook for a minute or two until slightly thickened.\n6. Pour the lemon butter sauce over the salmon fillets, garnish with fresh dill, and serve.\n\nMango Coconut Panna Cotta:\n1. In a saucepan, combine the mango puree, coconut milk, and sugar. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.\n2. In a separate small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin powder over 2 tablespoons of cold water. Allow it to bloom for a few minutes.\n3. Add the bloomed gelatin to the saucepan with the mango and coconut mixture. Stir well until the gelatin completely dissolves.\n4. Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.\n5. Pour the panna cotta mixture into individual serving glasses or ramekins. Allow them to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until set.\n6. Once the panna cotta is set, garnish each serving with fresh mint leaves and enjoy!\n\nI hope these instructions are clear and helpful!
