Start with the dishes that can be prepared in advance or require less time, such as the appetizers and desserts, and then move on to the main course.\n\n3. Ingredients and shopping: Review the ingredient lists for each recipe and make a comprehensive shopping list. Check your pantry for any items you already have and note down the ones you need to purchase. It's always a good idea to shop a day or two in advance to ensure you have everything you need.\n\n4.
