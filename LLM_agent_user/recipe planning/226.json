Mediterranean cuisine offers a wide range of flavors and has plenty of vegetarian options too. Here's a suggested three-course menu that should cater to everyone's preferences:\n\nStarter: Greek Salad\n- Ingredients: Romaine lettuce, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, red onion, Kalamata olives, feta cheese (omit for vegan option), olive oil, lemon juice, dried oregano, salt, and pepper.\n- Instructions: Chop the lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, and red onion. Toss them together with olives and feta cheese (if using). Drizzle with olive oil, lemon juice, and sprinkle with dried oregano, salt, and pepper.\n\nMain Course: Stuffed Bell Peppers\n- Ingredients: Bell peppers (assorted colors), quinoa (or rice), black beans, corn, onion, garlic, tomato sauce, cumin, paprika, chili powder, salt, pepper, and shredded cheese (optional).\n- Instructions: Cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds. In a pan, sauté onion and garlic until translucent. Add cooked quinoa, black beans, corn, tomato sauce, and spices. Mix well and stuff the mixture into the bell peppers. Bake in the oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 25-30 minutes. Top with shredded cheese (if desired) and bake for an additional 5 minutes.\n\nDessert: Fruit Skewers with Yogurt Dip\n- Ingredients: Assorted fruits (such as strawberries, pineapple, grapes, and melon), wooden skewers, Greek yogurt, honey, and vanilla extract.\n- Instructions: Cut the fruits into bite-sized pieces. Thread them onto the skewers. In a small bowl, mix Greek yogurt, honey, and vanilla extract to make a dip. Serve the fruit skewers with the yogurt dip on the side.\n\nThese dishes are flavorful, colorful, and provide a good balance of ingredients. They should be relatively easy to prepare, even for someone with limited cooking experience. I hope you and your friends enjoy the meal! Let me know if you need any further assistance.",

You can also add some fresh herbs like parsley or mint for extra flavor.\n\n2. When making the stuffed bell peppers, feel free to get creative with the filling. You can add other vegetables like zucchini or mushrooms, or even incorporate some spices like smoked paprika or oregano to enhance the flavor.\n\n3. If you're short on time, you can pre-cook the quinoa or rice ahead of time. This will help speed up the preparation process.\n\n4. When baking the stuffed bell peppers, keep an eye on them towards the end to ensure they don't overcook. You want the peppers to be tender but still hold their shape.\n\n5. For the fruit skewers, choose a variety of colorful fruits to make them visually appealing. Soak the wooden skewers in water beforehand to prevent them from burning in the oven.\n\n6. If you want to add an extra touch to the fruit skewers, you can lightly sprinkle them with a bit of cinnamon or a drizzle of melted dark chocolate before serving.\n\nRemember, cooking is all about having fun and experimenting. Don't be afraid to make adjustments to suit your taste preferences or get creative with presentation. Enjoy the process and have a wonderful time with your friends!
