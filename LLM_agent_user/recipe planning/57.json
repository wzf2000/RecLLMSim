Start with preparing the Vegan Chocolate Avocado Mousse. It needs some time to chill and set, so it's best to make it in advance and refrigerate it until ready to serve.\n\n2. Next, you can roast the beets for the Roasted Beet and Citrus Salad. You can do this ahead of time and keep them refrigerated until you're ready to assemble the salad.\n\n3. Prepare the Lentil and Vegetable Curry. Start by cooking the lentils and then proceed with sautéing the vegetables and adding the spices. This dish can be made ahead of time and reheated before serving.\n\n4. While the curry is simmering, you can prepare the filling for the Stuffed Bell Peppers. Cook the quinoa, black beans, corn, and any other desired ingredients. Once the filling is ready, stuff the bell peppers and bake them in the oven.\n\n5. While the bell peppers are baking, you can roast the Brussels sprouts and the baby potatoes. These side dishes can be cooked simultaneously in the oven.\n\n6. As the final touch, assemble the Roasted Beet and Citrus Salad by arranging the roasted beets, mixed greens, and citrus segments. Drizzle with the vinaigrette dressing just before serving.\n\n7. Once all the dishes are ready, it's time to set the table, garnish the dishes, and serve your guests!\n\nRemember to adjust the timing based on the cooking times of your specific recipes and the capacity of your kitchen. It's always a good idea to have a clear plan and prepare as much as you can in advance to minimize stress on the day of the celebration.\n\nI hope this timeline helps, and if you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
