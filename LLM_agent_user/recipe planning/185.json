Now, let's find some tasty side dishes and a delightful dessert to complement your spicy tofu stir-fry.\n\nFor a side dish, I suggest a simple and refreshing Cucumber Salad. Here's a quick recipe:\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 large cucumber, thinly sliced\n- 1/4 cup rice vinegar\n- 1 tablespoon soy sauce\n- 1 tablespoon sesame oil\n- 1 teaspoon sugar\n- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)\n- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro or mint (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n1. In a mixing bowl, combine rice vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and red pepper flakes (if using). Whisk until the sugar is dissolved.\n2. Add the thinly sliced cucumber to the bowl and toss to coat the cucumber slices evenly with the dressing.\n3. Let the cucumber salad marinate in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.\n4. Just before serving, sprinkle with chopped fresh cilantro or mint (if desired).\n\nThis cucumber salad is light, tangy, and pairs perfectly with the spicy stir-fry.\n\nNow, let's move on to dessert. How about a refreshing Mango Coconut Chia Pudding? Here's a simple recipe:\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 ripe mango, peeled and diced\n- 1 cup coconut milk\n- 3 tablespoons chia seeds\n- 1 tablespoon maple syrup or sweetener of your choice\n- Optional toppings: shredded coconut, sliced almonds, or fresh berries\n\nInstructions:\n1.

Stir well to combine.\n3. Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes, then stir again to prevent clumping. Repeat this process a few times over the course of 20-30 minutes.\n4. Cover the bowl or jar and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight to allow the chia seeds to thicken and absorb the liquid.\n5. Before serving, give the chia pudding a good stir. If desired, top with shredded coconut, sliced almonds, or fresh berries for added texture and flavor.\n\nThis Mango Coconut Chia Pudding is a delightful and healthy way to end your meal.\n\nI hope these side dish and dessert suggestions complement your spicy tofu stir-fry perfectly.
