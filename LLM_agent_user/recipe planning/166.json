It's always a pleasure to help out with cooking ideas.\n\nHere are a few additional tips to consider while preparing the dishes:\n\n1. For the lemon herb chicken:\n   - Marinate the chicken for at least 30 minutes before baking to allow the flavors to infuse into the meat.\n   - If you want a bit of extra tanginess, you can squeeze some fresh lemon juice over the chicken just before serving.\n\n2. For the roasted vegetables:\n   - Make sure to slice the vegetables into similar sizes to ensure even cooking.\n   - Feel free to experiment with different vegetables based on your preferences or what you have available. Asparagus, carrots, or cherry tomatoes can be great additions.\n\n3. For the fresh fruit salad:\n   - Choose ripe and seasonal fruits for the best flavor.\n   - If you're making the fruit salad in advance, add any delicate fruits, like berries, just before serving to prevent them from getting too soft.\n\n4. Presentation:\n   - Consider garnishing the dishes with some fresh herbs, such as parsley or basil, to add a pop of color.\n   - Plating the dishes attractively can enhance the overall dining experience. For example, you can arrange the roasted vegetables in a colorful pattern or serve the fruit salad in individual bowls or glasses.\n\nRemember, cooking is all about having fun and experimenting, so feel free to make any adjustments or additions to suit your taste.

            "content_zh": "非常欢迎！我很高兴你喜欢菜单。帮助烹饪理念总是一种愉快。以下是一些在准备菜肴时要考虑的额外提示：1. 关于柠檬香草鸡：-在烘烤之前，将鸡肉腌制至少30分钟，以便使味道渗入肉中。-如果你想要一些额外的酸味，可以在上菜前挤一些新鲜柠檬汁在鸡肉上。2. 关于烤蔬菜：-确保将蔬菜切成相似大小，以确保烹饪均匀。-根据您的喜好或所拥有的可用食材随意尝试不同的蔬菜。例如，芦笋、胡萝卜或樱桃番茄都是很好的选择。3. 关于新鲜水果沙拉：-选择熟透和应季水果获得最佳口味。-如果您提前制作水果沙拉，请在上菜前加入脆弱的水果，例如浆果，以防止它们变得太软。4. 装饰：-考虑用新鲜香草，如欧芹或罗勒，点缀菜肴以增加色彩。-将菜肴摆放得非常吸引眼球可以提升整体的用餐体验。例如，您可以将烤蔬菜摆放成彩色图案，或者将水果沙拉盛在个别碗或玻璃杯里。记住，烹饪是关于享受和尝试，所以随时进行调整或增加以迎合自己的口味。享受您的餐前准备时间和与朋友共度的时光！如果您有更多问题或需要进一步帮助，请不要犹豫询问。",
