Now, let's talk about the order of preparation and some additional tips to make your meal a success:\n\n1. Start with the desserts: Baklava can be made ahead of time, as it actually tastes better after a day or two. Prepare the baklava a day or two before your birthday celebration, so it has time to set and the flavors meld together. Keep it stored in an airtight container.\n\n2. Prepare the dips and appetizers: Hummus can be made a day in advance and refrigerated. The Greek Salad Skewers can be assembled shortly before serving to keep the vegetables fresh and crispy.\n\n3. Move on to the main course: Marinate the chicken for the Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken a few hours before cooking to allow the flavors to infuse. Preparing the spanakopita can be time-consuming, so consider making it a day in advance and reheating it before serving.\n\n4. Grill the vegetables: Prepare the Grilled Mediterranean Vegetables shortly before serving, as they taste best when warm and fresh off the grill.\n\n5. Make the sides: Tabbouleh can be made a few hours in advance and refrigerated to allow the flavors to marry. Roasted Potatoes can be prepared closer to serving time, as they are best when hot and crispy.\n\n6. Assemble the Fresh Fruit Platter just before serving to keep the fruits fresh and vibrant.\n\nRemember to read through each recipe thoroughly before starting and make a timeline that works for you. Prep work can be done in advance to save time on the day of the celebration. Don't hesitate to ask for help from your friends if needed, as cooking together can be fun and add to the celebration.\n\nLastly, enjoy the process of cooking and celebrate your birthday with your loved ones. I'm sure your homemade Mediterranean feast will be a memorable one. Happy cooking and have a fantastic birthday!",
