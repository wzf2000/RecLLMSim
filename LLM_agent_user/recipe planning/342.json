Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.\n2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, milk, egg, minced garlic, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly combined.\n3. Shape the mixture into meatballs, approximately 1-2 inches in diameter.\n4. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add a little oil. Cook the meatballs until browned on all sides and cooked through, about 8-10 minutes. Remove the meatballs from the skillet and set aside.\n5. In the same skillet, add the marinara sauce and bring it to a simmer. Add the cooked meatballs to the sauce and let them simmer for a few minutes to absorb the flavors.\n6. Serve the meatballs and sauce over the cooked spaghetti. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired.\n\nThis recipe is a great starting point, but feel free to customize it to your liking. You can add some sautéed onions and bell peppers to the sauce or experiment with different herbs and spices. And don't forget to enjoy your homemade meal!
