Here's a suggested menu:\n\nAppetizer: Mediterranean Mezze Platter\n- Ingredients: Hummus, Baba Ganoush (roasted eggplant dip), olives, cherry tomatoes, cucumber slices, pita bread or crackers.\n- Instructions: Prepare the hummus and baba ganoush by blending chickpeas and roasted eggplant respectively, along with garlic, lemon juice, tahini, and olive oil. Arrange the dips, olives, tomatoes, and cucumber slices on a platter. Serve with pita bread or crackers.\n\nMain Course: Asian Stir-Fried Tofu and Vegetables with Rice\n- Ingredients: Firm tofu, assorted vegetables (bell peppers, carrots, broccoli, etc.), soy sauce, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, rice.\n- Instructions: Drain and press the tofu to remove excess moisture, then cut it into cubes. Heat some sesame oil in a pan and add minced ginger and garlic. Stir-fry the tofu until golden brown, then remove from the pan. In the same pan, stir-fry the vegetables until crisp-tender. Add the tofu back to the pan, along with soy sauce. Cook for a few more minutes. Serve the stir-fry over cooked rice.\n\nDessert: Vegan Mango Coconut Rice Pudding\n- Ingredients: Coconut milk, cooked rice, ripe mango, maple syrup or agave syrup, shredded coconut (optional).\n- Instructions: In a saucepan, combine coconut milk and cooked rice. Simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens. Add sweetener to taste. Once the rice pudding has cooled, serve it with diced mango on top. Sprinkle shredded coconut for added texture if desired.\n\nThis meal plan includes a refreshing appetizer, a flavorful main course, and a delightful dessert.

If you want to enhance the flavors, you can add a squeeze of lime juice or sprinkle some fresh herbs like cilantro or mint on top of the stir-fry.\n\nRemember to taste as you go and adjust the seasonings according to your liking.
