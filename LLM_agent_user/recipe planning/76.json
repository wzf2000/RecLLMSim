Create a cozy ambiance: Set the table with a nice tablecloth, dim the lights, and use some candles or fairy lights to create a warm and inviting atmosphere. Consider playing some soft background music to enhance the mood.\n\n2. Signature cocktail/mocktail: Prepare a special drink to welcome your friends.

It adds a personal touch and shows that you've put thought into the entire dining experience.\n\n3. Appetizer variations: If you want to offer more variety, consider adding a second appetizer option. You could make a simple bruschetta with diced tomatoes, basil, garlic, and olive oil, or a seafood ceviche using diced fish or shrimp marinated in lime juice and mixed with onions, peppers, and cilantro.\n\n4. Side dishes: Complement the baked salmon with some delicious side dishes. Roasted asparagus or a mixed green salad with a tangy vinaigrette would go well with the flavors of the main course. You could also serve some crusty bread or herbed rice as a side.\n\n5. Personalized touch: Consider adding a personal touch to the meal by creating custom menus or place cards.
