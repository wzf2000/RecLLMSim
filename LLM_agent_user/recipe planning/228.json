How about a delicious and nutritious grilled chicken breast with quinoa and roasted vegetables? Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\nIngredients:\n- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n- 1 cup quinoa\n- Assorted vegetables (such as broccoli, bell peppers, zucchini, and carrots)\n- Olive oil\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Your choice of herbs and spices (such as garlic powder, paprika, or Italian seasoning)\n\nInstructions:\n1. Preheat your grill or stovetop grill pan to medium-high heat.\n2. Season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and your choice of herbs or spices. Drizzle them with a bit of olive oil.\n3. Grill the chicken breasts for about 6-8 minutes per side, or until they reach an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C). Cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the chicken breasts, so adjust accordingly.\n4. While the chicken is grilling, cook the quinoa according to the package instructions. Usually, you'll need to rinse the quinoa, combine it with water or broth, and simmer it for around 15-20 minutes until the liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is tender.\n5. Chop the assorted vegetables into bite-sized pieces and toss them with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast them in the oven at 400°F (200°C) for about 15-20 minutes or until they are cooked to your desired tenderness.\n6. Once the chicken, quinoa, and roasted vegetables are ready, plate them together and enjoy your post-workout meal!\n\nThis meal provides a good balance of protein from the chicken, complex carbohydrates from the quinoa, and a variety of vitamins and minerals from the vegetables. Feel free to customize the recipe by adding your favorite seasonings or swapping out the vegetables based on your preferences.",
