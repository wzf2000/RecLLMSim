Creamy Coconut Curry:\n   - Begin by preparing the tofu and chopping the vegetables.\n   - Sauté the tofu, garlic, and ginger in a large pan.\n   - Add the vegetables, coconut milk, curry paste or powder, and other seasonings.\n   - Allow the curry to simmer on low heat while you work on the other dishes.\n\n2. Stuffed Bell Peppers:\n   - Cook the quinoa according to package instructions.\n   - While the quinoa cooks, prepare the filling mixture by combining cooked black beans, corn, onion, garlic, and spices.\n   - Cut the tops off the bell peppers, remove the seeds and membranes, and stuff them with the filling mixture.\n   - Place the stuffed bell peppers in the oven to bake until the peppers are tender and the filling is heated through.\n\n3. Zucchini Noodle Stir-Fry:\n   - Spiralize the zucchini into noodles.\n   - Prepare the sauce by mixing together the garlic, ginger, soy sauce or tamari, sesame oil, lime juice, peanut butter, and sweetener.\n   - Sauté the vegetables in a large pan, adding the zucchini noodles towards the end.\n   - Pour the sauce over the vegetables and noodles, tossing everything together until well-coated and heated through.\n\nBy following this order, you can ensure that the main dishes are prepared and ready to serve in a timely manner. Of course, feel free to adjust the order or timings based on your preferences and kitchen setup.\n\nOnce you're ready to move on to the sides and dessert, you can choose the order that makes the most sense based on the cooking times and any last-minute preparations.
