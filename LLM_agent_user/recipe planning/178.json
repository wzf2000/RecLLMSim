Here's a suggested menu based on your preferences:\n\nAppetizer:\n- Shrimp Cocktail: Cook some large shrimp and serve them chilled with a tangy cocktail sauce. You can also add a touch of lemon or lime juice for extra freshness.\n\nMain Course:\n- Seared Salmon with Citrus Glaze: Season the salmon fillets with salt, pepper, and a bit of lemon zest. Sear them in a hot pan until crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Finish by brushing a citrus glaze made from a mixture of fresh orange and lemon juice, honey, and a touch of soy sauce.\n\nSides:\n- Roasted Vegetable Medley: Toss a variety of colorful vegetables like bell peppers, zucchini, cherry tomatoes, and asparagus with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast them in the oven until they're tender and slightly caramelized.\n- Creamy Mashed Potatoes: Boil peeled potatoes until soft, then mash them with butter, cream, salt, and pepper until smooth and creamy.\n\nDessert:\n- Chocolate Lava Cake: Bake individual chocolate cakes with a gooey, molten center. Serve them warm with a dusting of powdered sugar and a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.\n\nTo complete the ambiance, consider setting a beautiful table with candles, soft music, and perhaps a bouquet of flowers. And don't forget to pair your meal with a nice bottle of wine or your preferred beverage.\n\nI hope this menu helps you create a truly memorable dining experience for you and your loved one!
