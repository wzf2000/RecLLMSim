You can use a variety of vegetables like bell peppers, zucchini, mushrooms, and cherry tomatoes. Just marinate them in some olive oil, garlic, herbs, salt, and pepper, then thread them onto skewers and grill until they're nicely charred.\n\nFor the main course, let's go with grilled steak. It's a classic choice that's sure to please. You can pick a nice cut of steak like ribeye or sirloin, season it with salt, pepper, and your favorite herbs, and grill it to your desired level of doneness. Serve it with a side of grilled potatoes or a fresh salad for a well-rounded meal.\n\nFinally, for dessert, let's keep it simple yet satisfying with grilled peaches. Slice some ripe peaches in half, brush them with a little melted butter, sprinkle them with brown sugar and cinnamon, and grill them until they're caramelized and juicy. Serve them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for a delightful end to the meal.\n\nOf course, feel free to make any adjustments or additions based on your taste preferences and what you think your friends will enjoy.
