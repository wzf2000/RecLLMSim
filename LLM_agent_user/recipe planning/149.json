Add the minced garlic and tofu (if using) and stir-fry for about 2 minutes until the tofu is slightly browned.\n4. Push the tofu and garlic to one side of the skillet and pour the beaten eggs into the other side. Scramble the eggs until they are cooked through, then mix them with the tofu and garlic.\n5. Add the cooked rice noodles to the skillet and pour the sauce over them. Toss everything together until the noodles are well coated with the sauce.\n6. Add the bean sprouts and green onions to the skillet and stir-fry for an additional 1-2 minutes until the bean sprouts are slightly wilted.\n7. Remove from heat and serve the Pad Thai in bowls. Garnish with crushed peanuts (if desired) and serve with lime wedges for squeezing over the noodles.\n\nPad Thai is a great base recipe, and you can customize it by adding your favorite vegetables, protein (such as shrimp, chicken, or tofu), or additional toppings like cilantro or extra chili flakes.
