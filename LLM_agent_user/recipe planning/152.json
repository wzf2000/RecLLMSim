Let's start with a few ideas for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Feel free to let me know if any of these options stand out to you, or if you have any specific requests or preferences for each meal.\n\nFor breakfast, how about a simple yet nutritious option like overnight oats? You can prepare them the night before by combining rolled oats, milk (or a non-dairy alternative), a sweetener like honey or maple syrup, and any toppings you like such as fresh fruits, nuts, or seeds. They're easy to make and can be customized to your taste.\n\nFor lunch, a hearty salad with a protein source like grilled chicken or tofu could be a good choice. You can use a mix of fresh greens, vegetables, and a homemade dressing. If you prefer something warm, a vegetable stir-fry with brown rice or quinoa is also a healthy and satisfying option.\n\nFor dinner, let's go for a comforting yet balanced meal. How about baked salmon with roasted vegetables and a side of whole wheat couscous or quinoa? Salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, and roasting vegetables brings out their natural flavors. It's a delicious and nutritious combination.\n\nLet me know if these ideas resonate with you, or if you have any other specific preferences or requests for your meal plan!",

Layer Greek yogurt with your choice of fresh fruits, granola, and a drizzle of honey or maple syrup. It's a quick and easy option that provides a good balance of protein, fiber, and vitamins.\n\nFor a more substantial lunch, let's go with a twist on a classic sandwich. How about a grilled chicken or turkey club sandwich? Stack grilled chicken or turkey slices, crispy bacon, lettuce, tomato, and avocado on whole grain bread. You can add a spread like pesto or chipotle mayo for extra flavor. Serve it with a side of sweet potato fries or a small salad for a satisfying meal.\n\nAs for dinner, if you're not a fan of couscous or quinoa, you can consider options like roasted potatoes or steamed brown rice as a side dish to complement the baked salmon and roasted vegetables. Both options are versatile and can be seasoned to your liking.\n\nI hope these alternative suggestions meet your preferences.
