It's hearty, filling, and relatively easy to prepare. Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\nIngredients:\n- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n- 1 cup breadcrumbs (you can use seasoned or plain)\n- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n- 1/2 teaspoon dried basil\n- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano\n- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n- 2 eggs, beaten\n- Olive oil for frying\n- 1 cup marinara sauce\n- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese\n- Fresh basil or parsley for garnish (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).\n2. In a shallow bowl, mix together the breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, dried basil, dried oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.\n3. Place the flour in a separate shallow bowl, and the beaten eggs in another.\n4. Coat each chicken breast in flour, shaking off any excess. Dip it into the beaten eggs, allowing any excess to drip off, and then press it into the breadcrumb mixture, ensuring it's evenly coated.\n5. Heat a generous amount of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully place the breaded chicken breasts in the skillet and cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.\n6. Transfer the chicken breasts to a baking dish and spoon marinara sauce over each piece. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese on top.\n7. Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the cheese is melted and bubbly.\n8. Remove from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired.\n9. Serve the Chicken Parmesan with pasta, garlic bread, or a side salad for a complete meal.\n\nI hope you enjoy making and devouring this delicious Chicken Parmesan!

Since Chicken Parmesan is the main course, it's a good idea to focus on that first. Here's a suggested order of preparation:\n\n1. Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C) as mentioned in the Chicken Parmesan recipe.\n2. While the oven is preheating, proceed with breading and frying the chicken breasts according to the recipe instructions.\n3. Once the chicken is browned and crispy, transfer it to a baking dish, spoon marinara sauce over each piece, and sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese on top.\n4. Place the Chicken Parmesan in the preheated oven and let it bake for 20-25 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the cheese is melted and bubbly.\n5. While the Chicken Parmesan is baking, you can prepare any accompanying dishes you'd like to serve. Here are a few suggestions:\n   - Pasta: Cook your favorite pasta according to the package instructions. You can serve the Chicken Parmesan on top of the pasta or alongside it.\n   - Garlic Bread: Slice a baguette or Italian bread, spread some butter or garlic butter on each slice, and toast them in the oven until golden and crispy.\n   - Side Salad: Prepare a simple green salad with your choice of lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and any other veggies you like. Toss it with your favorite dressing.\n6. Once the Chicken Parmesan is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.\n7. Plate the Chicken Parmesan alongside the pasta, garlic bread, and/or side salad.\n8. Garnish the Chicken Parmesan with fresh basil or parsley, if desired.\n9. Serve everything while it's still warm and enjoy your homemade meal!\n\nRemember, feel free to customize the meal to your liking by adding or substituting any dishes you prefer. Cooking should be a fun and creative experience. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to ask. Happy cooking!",
