Planning the preparation process and order of dishes is an important step to ensure a smooth cooking experience.\n\nTo make things easier, here's a suggested order of preparation:\n\n1. Start by preparing the pie crust for the apple pie. If you're using store-bought crust, follow the instructions on the package. If you're making it from scratch, prepare the dough and let it chill in the refrigerator while you work on other dishes.\n\n2. Preheat the oven for the roast chicken and potatoes. While the oven is heating up, you can start prepping the chicken by rinsing it, patting it dry, and seasoning it with salt, pepper, and your chosen herbs. Set it aside to marinate for a bit.\n\n3. Move on to preparing the stuffed bell peppers. Cook the quinoa according to the package instructions. Sauté the vegetables, then mix them with the cooked quinoa and cheese. Stuff the mixture into the bell peppers, and they're ready to be baked.\n\n4. Once the oven is preheated, start roasting the chicken. Place it in a roasting pan, drizzle with olive oil, and add some garlic cloves for extra flavor. Roast according to the weight of the chicken, following cooking time guidelines.\n\n5. While the chicken is roasting, prepare the roasted potatoes. Cut them into desired sizes, toss them in olive oil, salt, pepper, and herbs, then spread them on a baking sheet. Roast them in the oven until golden and crispy.\n\n6. While the chicken and potatoes are in the oven, you can focus on the seasonal vegetables. Clean and chop the vegetables, toss them in olive oil, salt, and pepper, and roast them until tender.\n\n7. Once the main course is cooked and the chicken has rested, you can assemble the apple pie. Peel, core, and slice the apples, then toss them with sugar, cinnamon, and a squeeze of lemon juice. Place the apple mixture into the prepared pie crust, dot with butter, cover with the second crust (or lattice if you prefer), and bake until golden and bubbly.\n\nRemember to adjust the cooking times and temperatures based on your oven and the size of the chicken. It's always a good idea to have a meat thermometer on hand to ensure the chicken is cooked through.\n\nI hope this breakdown helps you with your planning process!
