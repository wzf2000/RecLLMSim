Then, chop the vegetables and prepare the lemon vinaigrette. Toss everything together and refrigerate until serving.\n6. After the stuffed bell peppers are done, you can focus on making the roasted garlic hummus. It's a simple process of blending cooked chickpeas, roasted garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil. Serve it with gluten-free crackers and fresh veggies.\n7. Lastly, prepare the chocolate avocado mousse. Blend the avocados, cocoa powder, maple syrup, and vanilla extract until smooth. Refrigerate it until you're ready to serve dessert.\n\nBy following this order, you can efficiently utilize your time and have everything ready to enjoy with your friends.
