In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, minced garlic, dried herbs, salt, and pepper. Mix everything together to create a marinade.\n\n3. Place the chicken breasts in a baking dish or a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.\n\n4. Pour the marinade over the chicken, making sure to coat both sides. You can use a brush or simply use your hands to evenly distribute the marinade.\n\n5. Once the chicken is coated, let it marinate for about 15-20 minutes. This will allow the flavors to infuse into the meat.\n\n6. After marinating, place the baking dish or sheet pan with the chicken in the preheated oven.\n\n7. Bake for approximately 20-25 minutes or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C). Cooking times may vary depending on the thickness of the chicken breasts, so keep an eye on them.\n\n8. Once the chicken is cooked through, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before serving. This will help the juices redistribute and keep the meat tender.\n\n9. Serve the Baked Lemon Herb Chicken with your choice of sides, such as steamed vegetables, roasted potatoes, or a fresh salad.\n\nThat's it!
