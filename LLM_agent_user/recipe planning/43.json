            "content": "I'm glad you're excited about the menu! Here are more detailed recipes for each dish:\n\n1. Grilled Shrimp Skewers:\n   - In a bowl, combine lime juice, minced garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper.\n   - Add the shrimp to the marinade and let them marinate for about 15-20 minutes.\n   - Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.\n   - Thread the shrimp onto skewers and grill for about 2-3 minutes per side, until they turn pink and opaque.\n   - Serve the grilled shrimp skewers as an appetizer.\n\n2. Grilled Steak with Herb Butter:\n   - Preheat the grill to high heat.\n   - Season the steak generously with salt and pepper on both sides.\n   - Grill the steak to your desired level of doneness (about 4-5 minutes per side for medium-rare, but adjust according to the thickness of the steak).\n   - While the steak rests, prepare the herb butter by combining softened butter with finely chopped fresh herbs (rosemary, thyme, and parsley) in a bowl.\n   - Slice the steak and top it with a dollop of herb butter.\n\n3. Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes:\n   - Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).\n   - Cut the top off a head of garlic, drizzle with olive oil, wrap it in aluminum foil, and roast for about 30-35 minutes until the cloves are soft and golden.\n   - Boil peeled and quartered potatoes in salted water until tender. Drain well.\n   - Squeeze the roasted garlic cloves into a small bowl and mash them into a paste.\n   - In a large pot, melt butter over low heat, add the roasted garlic paste, and stir for a minute.\n   - Add the cooked potatoes, milk or cream, salt, and pepper. Mash until smooth and creamy.\n\n4. Grilled Vegetable Medley:\n   - Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.\n   - Slice the vegetables into manageable pieces and toss them in a bowl with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper.\n   - Grill the vegetables for about 8-10 minutes, turning occasionally, until they are tender and lightly charred.\n   - Remove from the grill and serve as a side dish.\n\n5. Lavender or Citrus Crème Brûlée:\n   - Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C).\n   - In a saucepan, heat the cream over medium heat until it starts to steam (do not let it boil).\n   - In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, vanilla extract, and lavender buds or citrus zest.\n   - Slowly pour the hot cream into the egg mixture while whisking continuously.\n   - Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any solids.\n   - Pour the custard into ramekins and place them in a baking dish. Fill the dish with hot water halfway up the sides of the ramekins.\n   - Bake for about 30-35 minutes until the custard is set but still slightly jiggly in the center.\n   - Remove from the oven, let them cool, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.\n   - Just before serving, sprinkle a thin layer of brown or granulated sugar on top of each custard and caramelize it using a kitchen torch or broiler.\n\nIn terms of the order of preparation, I suggest starting with the roasted garlic for the mashed potatoes since it takes some time in the oven. While the garlic is roasting, you can prepare the marinade for the shrimp and let them marinate. Next, move on to the crème brûlée, as it requires some baking and chilling time. Once the garlic is done, you can boil the potatoes and prepare the herb butter for the steak. Finally, grill the shrimp skewers, steak, and vegetables. Serve the dishes in the order of appetizer, main course, and sides.\n\nI hope these recipes and suggestions help you create a memorable dining experience!

            "content_zh": "我很高兴你对菜单感到兴奋！以下是每道菜的更详细食谱：\n\n1. 烤虾串：\n- 在一个碗里，将青柠汁、切碎的大蒜、橄榄油、盐和胡椒混合在一起。\n- 将虾放入腌料中，腌约15-20分钟。\n- 预热烧烤炉至中高温。\n- 把虾串起来，每面烤约2-3分钟，直到它们变成粉红色和不透明。\n- 将烤虾串作为开胃菜。\n\n2. 香草奶油烤牛排：\n- 预热烧烤炉至高温。\n- 双面将牛排慷慨地撒上盐和胡椒。\n- 将牛排烤至您想要的熟度（中熟约每面4-5分钟，但根据牛排的厚度调整）。\n- 当牛排休息时，准备香草奶油，将软化的黄油与切碎的新鲜香草（迷迭香、百里香和欧芹）混合在一个碗中。\n- 切开牛排，加一勺香草奶油。\n\n3. 烤大蒜土豆泥：\n- 预热烤箱至400°F（200°C）。\n- 剪除一个大蒜头的顶部，撒上橄榄油，用铝箔包裹，烤约30-35分钟，直到大蒜酱软和金黄。\n- 用含盐水煮熟、剥皮并切块的土豆直到变软。沥干。\n- 把烤大蒜酱挤入一个小碗中，并捣成蒜泥。\n- 在一个大锅里，用小火熔化黄油，加入烤大蒜酱，搅拌一分钟。\n- 加入煮熟的土豆、牛奶或奶油、盐和胡椒。捣碎直到光滑和奶油。\n\n4. 烤蔬菜拼盘：\n- 预热烧烤炉至中高温。\n- 把蔬菜切成适当大小的块，和橄榄油、香醋、盐和胡椒混合在一个碗里。\n- 烤蔬菜约8-10分钟，时而翻转，直至软嫩和略焦。\n- 从烤架上取下，作为配菜。\n\n5. 薰衣草或柑橘焦糖奶酪：\n- 预热烤箱至325°F（160°C）。\n- 在一个锅中，将奶油加热至中火直到开始冒烟（不要让它沸腾）。\n- 在另一个碗中，拌匀蛋黄、糖、香草精和薰衣草花或柑橘皮屑。\n- 缓慢地将热奶倒入蛋液中，不断搅拌。\n- 通过细网筛将混合物过滤掉任何固体物质。\n- 将奶油倒入瓷碗中，放入烤盘中。在瓷碗周围加一半热水。\n- 烤约30-35分钟，直到奶酪凝固但中心还略微晃动。\n- 从烤箱中取出，冷却后冷藏至少2小时。\n- 在上面撒一层薄薄的棕糖或砂糖，在上面用厨房焊枪或烤炉将其焦化。\n\n就准备顺序而言，我建议从烤大蒜土豆泥开始，因为它需要一些时间在烤箱里。当大蒜在烤箱里时，您可以准备虾的腌料并腌制它们。接下来，继续制作焦糖奶酪，因为它需要一些烘烤和冷藏时间。一旦大蒜烤好，您可以煮土豆并为牛排准备香草奶油。最后，烤虾串、牛排和蔬菜。按照前菜、主菜和配菜的顺序上菜。\n\n希望这些食谱和建议能帮助您创造一次难忘的用餐体验！如果您有任何问题或需要进一步协助，请告诉我。",
