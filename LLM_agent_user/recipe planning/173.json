Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).\n2. In a small bowl, mix together the olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, minced garlic, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper.\n3. Place the chicken breasts in a baking dish and pour the marinade over them, making sure they are coated evenly. Let them marinate for 15-20 minutes.\n4. While the chicken is marinating, prepare the vegetables. Cut them into bite-sized pieces and place them on a separate baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and toss to coat.\n5. Place both the chicken and vegetables in the preheated oven. Bake the chicken for about 20-25 minutes or until cooked through (internal temperature of 165°F or 74°C) and the vegetables for about 15-20 minutes or until tender and slightly charred.\n6. Once everything is cooked, remove from the oven and let the chicken rest for a few minutes before slicing it.\n7. Serve the lemon herb baked chicken with the roasted vegetables on the side.\n\nFor a complete meal, you can also add a simple side dish like a Greek salad or some couscous.
