Add the diced carrots and bell peppers to the pan and stir-fry for about 2-3 minutes until they start to soften.\n5. Push the ingredients to one side of the pan and crack the eggs into the empty space. Scramble them until they're cooked through, then mix them with the rest of the ingredients.\n6. Add the cooked jasmine rice to the pan and break up any clumps with a spatula. Stir-fry everything together for a few minutes.\n7. Now, add the soy sauce, fish sauce (if using), and curry powder to the pan. Stir well to evenly coat the rice and other ingredients.\n8. Add the frozen peas and pineapple chunks to the pan. Stir-fry for another 2-3 minutes until everything is heated through.\n9. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed. You can add more soy sauce or curry powder according to your preference.\n10. Once everything is cooked and well combined, remove the pan from the heat.\n\nYour Pineapple Fried Rice is now ready to be served! Transfer it to a serving dish and garnish with cashews or peanuts for added crunch, as well as fresh cilantro or green onions for a pop of color.\n\nI hope you enjoy making and eating this flavorful dish!
