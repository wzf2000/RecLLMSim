You can stuff the chicken with a combination of ingredients like spinach, feta cheese, and sun-dried tomatoes, or perhaps a mixture of mushrooms, onions, and Swiss cheese. The options are endless!\n\nTo accompany the stuffed chicken breast, you could make some roasted vegetables, such as carrots, zucchini, and bell peppers, seasoned with herbs and olive oil. This will add color and flavor to the plate.\n\nDoes this sound appealing to you, or would you prefer another suggestion for the main course?",
