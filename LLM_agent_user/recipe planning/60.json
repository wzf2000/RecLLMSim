Since you mentioned using fresh and seasonal ingredients, let's design a menu that highlights the best of what's available. Here's a suggested vegetarian menu for your gathering:\n\nStarter:\n- Roasted Beet and Goat Cheese Salad: This vibrant salad combines roasted beets, creamy goat cheese, toasted walnuts, and a light vinaigrette dressing. It's a refreshing way to start the meal.\n\nMain Course:\n- Stuffed Portobello Mushrooms: Portobello mushrooms make a fantastic vegetarian main course option. Stuff them with a mixture of sautéed vegetables, breadcrumbs, herbs, and cheese. Serve them with a side of roasted potatoes or a fresh salad.\n\nSide Dish:\n- Seasonal Ratatouille: Ratatouille is a classic French dish that celebrates the flavors of seasonal vegetables. Sautee an assortment of vegetables like eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers, and tomatoes with herbs like thyme and basil. It's a colorful and delicious side dish.\n\nDessert:\n- Fresh Fruit Tart: For a light and fruity dessert, make a fresh fruit tart using a buttery crust and a sweet pastry cream filling. Top it with a variety of fresh seasonal fruits like berries, peaches, or kiwi.\n\nTo accompany the meal, you can serve some freshly baked bread or offer a selection of cheeses and crackers as an appetizer. And don't forget to have some refreshing beverages like infused water, herbal teas, or a fruity mocktail.\n\nI hope this menu sounds appealing to you and your friends!
