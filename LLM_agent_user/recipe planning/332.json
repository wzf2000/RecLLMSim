With those preferences in mind, I have a few ideas that might work well for your birthday celebration.\n\nFor starters, a colorful and refreshing salad would be a good choice. Consider a mixed greens salad with a variety of vegetables like cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, and avocado. You could also add some toasted nuts or seeds for added crunch and a light vinaigrette dressing.\n\nAs for the main course, a vegetarian or vegan option could be a flavorful roasted vegetable medley. You can roast a mix of seasonal vegetables such as carrots, zucchini, bell peppers, and sweet potatoes, seasoned with herbs and spices. It's a versatile dish that can be customized to your taste.\n\nAnother option is a delicious mushroom risotto. Risotto is a creamy and comforting dish that can be made with vegetable broth and a variety of mushrooms like cremini, shiitake, or porcini. It's a crowd-pleaser and can be served as a main course or a side dish.\n\nFor dessert, you could consider a fruit-based option like a mixed berry crumble or a vegan chocolate avocado mousse. Both are delicious and relatively easy to prepare.\n\nOf course, these are just a few ideas to get you started. Let me know if you have any specific preferences or if there's anything else I can help you with!",

Mixed Greens Salad:\n- Ingredients: Mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, avocado, toasted nuts or seeds, vinaigrette dressing (olive oil, vinegar, Dijon mustard, honey, salt, and pepper).\n- Preparation: Wash and dry the mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, and bell peppers. Chop the tomatoes, cucumbers, and bell peppers into bite-sized pieces. Cut the avocado into slices. In a bowl, combine the mixed greens, chopped vegetables, avocado slices, and toasted nuts or seeds. In a separate bowl, whisk together the vinaigrette dressing ingredients. Drizzle the dressing over the salad just before serving.\n\n2. Roasted Vegetable Medley:\n- Ingredients: Seasonal vegetables (carrots, zucchini, bell peppers, sweet potatoes, etc.), olive oil, salt, pepper, herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, or oregano).\n- Preparation: Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Wash and chop the vegetables into similar-sized pieces. Toss the vegetables in olive oil, salt, pepper, and your choice of herbs. Spread them out on a baking sheet and roast for about 25-30 minutes, or until they are tender and slightly caramelized. Stir the vegetables once or twice during cooking for even browning.\n\n3. Mushroom Risotto:\n- Ingredients: Arborio rice, vegetable broth, mushrooms (cremini, shiitake, porcini, etc.), onion, garlic, white wine (optional), olive oil, butter (or vegan butter), Parmesan cheese (or vegan alternative), salt, pepper, fresh herbs (such as thyme or parsley).\n- Preparation: In a large saucepan, heat olive oil and sauté finely chopped onion and minced garlic until translucent. Add the Arborio rice and stir for a minute until it's coated with oil. If using white wine, pour it into the pan and stir until it evaporates. Gradually add vegetable broth, one ladle at a time, stirring constantly until the liquid is absorbed before adding more. In a separate pan, sauté sliced mushrooms until browned and add them to the risotto. Continue adding broth and stirring until the rice is al dente and creamy. Stir in butter, Parmesan cheese (or vegan alternative), salt, pepper, and fresh herbs to taste.\n\n4. Mixed Berry Crumble:\n- Ingredients: Mixed berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, etc.), lemon juice, sugar (or sweetener of choice), flour (or gluten-free alternative), oats, butter (or vegan butter), cinnamon, salt.\n- Preparation: Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). In a bowl, combine the mixed berries, lemon juice, and sugar. In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, oats, sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Pour the berry mixture into a baking dish and sprinkle the crumble mixture over the top. Bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until the berries are bubbling and the crumble is golden brown.\n\nRemember to adjust the quantities of each recipe based on the number of guests you're expecting. And don't forget to taste and adjust the seasoning as you go along. Enjoy your birthday celebration and the delicious meal!",
