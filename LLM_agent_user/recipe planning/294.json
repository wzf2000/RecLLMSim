Grilled Lemon Herb Chicken:\n- Ingredients: Chicken breasts, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic (minced), fresh rosemary, fresh thyme, salt, and pepper.\n- Tip: Marinate the chicken for at least 30 minutes to infuse it with flavor.

Spanakopita:\n- Ingredients: Phyllo pastry sheets, spinach (frozen or fresh), feta cheese, onions, garlic, olive oil, dill, salt, and pepper.\n- Tip: Squeeze out any excess water from the spinach before using it in the filling.

Make sure to cut the baklava into pieces before baking and pour the sugar syrup over it once it's out of the oven.\n\nRemember, these are just basic recipes, and you can adjust them to suit your taste preferences.
