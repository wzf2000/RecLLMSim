Here's a recipe for grilled lemon herb chicken with roasted vegetables:\n\nIngredients:\n- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice\n- 1 teaspoon lemon zest\n- 1 teaspoon dried thyme\n- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n\nFor the roasted vegetables:\n- 2 cups mixed vegetables (such as bell peppers, zucchini, and cherry tomatoes)\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n\nInstructions:\n1. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.\n2. In a small bowl, mix together the olive oil, minced garlic, lemon juice, lemon zest, dried thyme, dried rosemary, salt, and pepper.\n3. Place the chicken breasts in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over them. Make sure the chicken is coated evenly. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours in the refrigerator.\n4. While the chicken is marinating, preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).\n5. Toss the mixed vegetables with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread them out on a baking sheet and roast in the oven for about 20-25 minutes or until they are tender and slightly caramelized.\n6. Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard any excess marinade. Grill the chicken breasts for about 6-8 minutes per side or until they reach an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C). Cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the chicken breasts, so keep an eye on them.\n7. Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing.\n8. Serve the grilled chicken with the roasted vegetables on the side. You can also add a side of steamed rice or a fresh green salad for a complete meal.\n\nThis recipe should provide you with a delicious and nutritious meal.
