You can refrigerate it and then reheat it just before serving.\n- Marinate the chicken for the Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken. This will allow the flavors to develop.\n\nOn the day of the celebration:\n- Start by preparing the stuffed bell peppers. You can assemble them ahead of time and refrigerate until you're ready to bake them.\n- While the stuffed bell peppers are baking, you can work on the Caprese skewers. Skewer the cherry tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil leaves. Drizzle them with balsamic glaze just before serving.\n- Next, roast the garlic for the mashed potatoes. Once roasted, you can easily mash it into the potatoes later.\n- Prepare the chocolate lava cake batter and set it aside until you're ready to bake them. Remember to preheat the oven.\n\nAbout an hour before guests arrive:\n- Start roasting the chicken. While it's roasting, you can prepare the mashed potatoes. Boil the potatoes, mash them, and mix in the roasted garlic for that extra flavor.\n- Once the chicken is done, let it rest for a few minutes before serving.\n- While the chicken is resting, grill the vegetables. This won't take long, and you can keep them warm until it's time to serve.\n\nJust before serving:\n- Bake the stuffed bell peppers until they're tender and the cheese is nicely melted.\n- Bake the chocolate lava cakes, as they are best served warm and fresh.\n\nDuring the meal, you can keep the Spinach and Artichoke Dip warm and serve it with some toasted bread or tortilla chips as an appetizer.\n\nRemember to delegate tasks to your friends if they're willing to help. It can make the preparation process more enjoyable and efficient. And most importantly, don't forget to have fun and enjoy the celebration with your friends!
