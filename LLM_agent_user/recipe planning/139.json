Grill them until cooked through, and serve with a side of roasted vegetables or a Greek salad.\n\nSide Dishes:\n4. Greek Salad: A refreshing and colorful salad made with tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, Kalamata olives, and feta cheese. Toss it with a simple dressing of olive oil, lemon juice, and oregano.\n5. Roasted Vegetables: Choose a mix of Mediterranean vegetables like zucchini, eggplant, bell peppers, and cherry tomatoes. Toss them with olive oil, garlic, and herbs, then roast until tender.\n\nDessert:\n6. Baklava: This classic Mediterranean dessert consists of layers of flaky phyllo pastry filled with a sweet mixture of nuts (such as walnuts or pistachios) and honey syrup.
