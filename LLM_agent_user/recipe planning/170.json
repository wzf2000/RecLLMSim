It's a Spanish dish that combines various seafood with rice and aromatic spices. Finally, for dessert, we can make a refreshing mango mousse.

Here's a recipe for Matcha Green Tea Lava Cake:\n\nIngredients:\n- 4 ounces white chocolate\n- 1/2 cup unsalted butter\n- 2 eggs\n- 2 egg yolks\n- 1/4 cup granulated sugar\n- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour\n- 2 tablespoons matcha green tea powder\n- Powdered sugar, for dusting\n- Whipped cream or vanilla ice cream (optional), for serving\n\nInstructions:\n1. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Grease four individual ramekins with butter or cooking spray and place them on a baking sheet.\n2. In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the white chocolate and butter together in short intervals, stirring until smooth. Set aside to cool slightly.\n3. In a separate large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs, egg yolks, and granulated sugar until well combined.\n4. Slowly pour the melted chocolate mixture into the egg mixture, whisking constantly.\n5. Sift in the all-purpose flour and matcha green tea powder. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.\n6. Divide the batter equally among the prepared ramekins, filling them about 3/4 full.\n7. Bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center is still slightly jiggly.\n8. Remove the ramekins from the oven and let them rest for 1-2 minutes. Carefully run a knife around the edges of each ramekin, then invert the cakes onto individual serving plates.\n9. Dust the cakes with powdered sugar and serve immediately. You can also serve them with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream if desired.\n\nEnjoy your unique and adventurous matcha green tea lava cake! It's best to serve them right away while the center is still warm and gooey. Let me know if you need any further assistance or have any other questions. Happy cooking!",
