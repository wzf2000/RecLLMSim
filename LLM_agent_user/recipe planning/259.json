Sauté the onion, garlic, and ginger, then add the tomatoes, spices, and chickpeas. Let it simmer while you move on to the next step.\n\n4. Once the curry is simmering:\n   - Cook the coconut rice according to the package instructions, as it takes some time to cook.\n\n5. When the curry and rice are almost ready:\n   - Blend the ingredients for the chocolate avocado mousse and chill it in the refrigerator.\n\n6. Just before serving the main course:\n   - Check the seasoning of the curry and adjust if needed.\n   - Plate the coconut rice alongside the curry.\n\n7. After the main course:\n   - Serve the chilled chocolate avocado mousse as the final course, garnished with fresh berries.\n\nRemember to enjoy the process and have fun while cooking!
