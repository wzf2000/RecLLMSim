Quinoa is a protein-rich grain that pairs well with grilled salmon and offers a nice texture and flavor contrast. Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\nIngredients for the Quinoa Salad:\n- 1 cup quinoa\n- 2 cups water or vegetable broth\n- 1 cucumber, diced\n- 1 bell pepper, diced (you can use any color you prefer)\n- 1 small red onion, finely chopped\n- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved\n- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped\n- Juice of 1 lemon\n- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n\nInstructions:\n1. Rinse the quinoa thoroughly under cold water to remove any bitterness.\n2. In a saucepan, bring the water or vegetable broth to a boil. Add the rinsed quinoa, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is tender. Remove from heat and let it cool for a few minutes.\n3. In a large bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, diced cucumber, bell pepper, red onion, cherry tomatoes, and chopped parsley.\n4. In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Pour the dressing over the quinoa salad and toss gently to combine.\n5. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed. You can also add some additional herbs or spices according to your preference.\n6. Cover the salad and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.\n\nNow, let's move on to grilling the salmon:\n\nIngredients for Grilled Salmon:\n- Fresh salmon fillets\n- Olive oil\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n\nInstructions:\n1. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.\n2. Brush both sides of the salmon fillets with olive oil and season them with salt and pepper.\n3. Place the salmon fillets on the grill, skin-side down, and close the lid. Cook for about 4-6 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the fillets. The salmon should be opaque and easily flake with a fork.\n4. Once cooked, remove the salmon from the grill and let it rest for a couple of minutes before serving.\n\nWhen serving, plate the grilled salmon alongside a portion of the quinoa salad. You can garnish the salmon with some fresh herbs, such as dill or parsley, for added flavor and presentation. I hope you enjoy this nutritious and tasty meal!
