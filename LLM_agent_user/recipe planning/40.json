How about a menu that includes a delicious appetizer, a main course with a protein-rich dish, some sides, and a delightful dessert?\n\nFor the appetizer, you could try making bacon-wrapped shrimp with a tangy dipping sauce. It's a crowd-pleaser and relatively easy to prepare.\n\nFor the main course, a classic option could be herb-roasted chicken or grilled salmon. Both dishes are flavorful and can be paired with various sides.\n\nSpeaking of sides, you could consider serving roasted vegetables like carrots, Brussels sprouts, and sweet potatoes. They are simple to prepare and provide a nice balance to the main dish.\n\nFinally, for dessert, how about a homemade chocolate lava cake? It's a rich and decadent treat that is sure to impress your friends.\n\nDoes that sound like a good starting point? Let me know if you have any specific preferences or if you'd like more details on any of the dishes!",
