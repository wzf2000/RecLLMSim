Let's create a menu that incorporates those flavors while keeping it high in protein and low in carbs. Here are some suggestions for appetizers, main courses, and desserts:\n\nAppetizer:\n1. Grilled Vegetable Skewers: Thread colorful vegetables like bell peppers, zucchini, and cherry tomatoes onto skewers, brush them with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and grill until tender and slightly charred. Serve with a side of tzatziki sauce for dipping.\n\n2. Greek Salad: Toss together crisp lettuce, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, red onion, Kalamata olives, and feta cheese. Dress it with a simple vinaigrette made with olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and dried oregano.\n\nMain Courses:\n1. Grilled Lemon Herb Chicken: Marinate chicken breasts in a mixture of lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, fresh herbs like rosemary and thyme, salt, and pepper. Grill until cooked through and serve with a side of grilled asparagus or roasted vegetables.\n\n2. Herb-Crusted Baked Salmon: Coat salmon fillets with a mixture of chopped fresh herbs (such as dill, parsley, and basil), minced garlic, lemon zest, and a little olive oil. Bake until the fish is cooked to your liking and serve with a side of cauliflower rice or a mixed green salad.\n\nDessert:\n1. Lemon Olive Oil Cake: This light and moist cake is a perfect ending to a Mediterranean meal. Use almond flour or a low-carb flour alternative, and sweeten with a sugar substitute. Drizzle with a lemon glaze made with fresh lemon juice and powdered sweetener.\n\n2. Greek Yogurt with Berries and Honey: Serve a bowl of Greek yogurt topped with a mix of fresh berries (such as strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries) and a drizzle of honey. It's a refreshing and low-carb dessert option.\n\nThese are just a few ideas to get you started. Feel free to adjust the recipes according to your preferences and dietary needs.
