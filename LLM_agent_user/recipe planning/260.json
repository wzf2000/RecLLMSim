For a Thai-inspired dessert, I recommend trying Mango Sticky Rice. It's a popular and delicious Thai dessert that combines the natural sweetness of mangoes with sticky glutinous rice and a coconut sauce.

Rinse the glutinous rice with water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for at least 4 hours or overnight.\n2. Drain the soaked rice and steam it for about 20-25 minutes until it becomes tender and sticky.\n3. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, heat the coconut milk, sugar, and salt over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and let it cool.\n4. Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a bowl and pour half of the coconut sauce over it. Mix well to coat the rice evenly.\n5. To serve, place a portion of the sticky rice on a plate and add a few slices of ripe mango on the side.\n6. Drizzle some more of the coconut sauce over the mango and rice.\n7. Enjoy the Mango Sticky Rice while it's still warm or at room temperature.\n\nMango Sticky Rice is a delightful and refreshing dessert that balances the flavors of sweet mangoes, creamy coconut, and sticky rice.
