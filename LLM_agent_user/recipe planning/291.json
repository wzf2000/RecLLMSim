It's a classic and indulgent dish that's sure to impress.\n\nDessert:\n- Tiramisu: Layer ladyfingers soaked in coffee and rum with a creamy mixture of mascarpone cheese, sugar, and whipped cream. Dust the top with cocoa powder for an elegant finish. Tiramisu is a crowd-pleaser and a perfect way to end an Italian feast.\n\nFor the Mediterranean Mezze, consider these recipes:\n\nMain Course:\n- Grilled Chicken Kebabs: Marinate chunks of chicken in a mixture of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and Mediterranean spices like oregano and paprika. Skewer them and grill until cooked through. Serve with tzatziki sauce on the side.\n\nDessert:\n- Baklava: Layer sheets of phyllo pastry with a mixture of chopped nuts (such as walnuts, pistachios, or almonds), sugar, and spices. Bake until golden and crispy, then drizzle with a sweet syrup made of honey and lemon juice. Baklava is a rich and decadent dessert that pairs perfectly with a cup of coffee or tea.\n\nThese are just a couple of ideas to get you started, but there are countless other recipes you can explore within these themes.
