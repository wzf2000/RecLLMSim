Here's a suggestion:\n\nAppetizer: Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp Skewers\n- Ingredients: Large shrimp, bacon slices, lemon juice, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.\n- This appetizer is simple yet delicious. Wrap each shrimp with a slice of bacon, season with garlic powder, salt, and pepper, and then grill or bake them until the bacon is crispy and the shrimp is cooked through. Serve with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.\n\nMain Course: Herb-Crusted Pork Tenderloin with Roasted Vegetables\n- Ingredients: Pork tenderloin, fresh herbs (such as rosemary, thyme, and sage), garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, potatoes, carrots, and Brussels sprouts.\n- Rub the pork tenderloin with a mixture of chopped herbs, garlic, salt, pepper, and olive oil. Sear the tenderloin on all sides in a hot pan, then transfer it to the oven to finish cooking. Meanwhile, toss the potatoes, carrots, and Brussels sprouts with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and roast them until golden and tender.\n\nDessert: Berry Parfait with Vanilla Cream\n- Ingredients: Mixed berries (such as strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries), Greek yogurt, honey, vanilla extract, granola, and mint leaves (optional).\n- Layer the mixed berries with a mixture of Greek yogurt, honey, and vanilla extract in serving glasses. Top with some granola for crunch and garnish with mint leaves if desired. It's a refreshing and light dessert option.\n\nThese dishes should be relatively easy to prepare, and they offer a nice variety of flavors and textures. Let me know if you like these suggestions, or if you'd like more options or specific recipes for any of the dishes!",
            "content_zh": "太好了！考虑到这些偏好，让我们一起为您的餐点想想点子。怎么样一个包括开胃菜、主菜和甜点的三道菜单？这里有个建议：\n\n开胃菜：培根虾串\n- 食材：大虾、培根片、柠檬汁、大蒜粉、盐和胡椒。\n- 这个开胃菜简单而美味。每只虾用一片培根包裹，撒上大蒜粉、盐和胡椒，然后烤或烤箱烤至培根酥脆、虾熟透。配上一勺新鲜柠檬汁。\n\n主菜：香草烤猪柳配烤蔬菜\n- 食材：猪柳、新鲜香草（如迷迭香、百里香、鼠尾草）、大蒜、橄榄油、盐、胡椒、土豆、胡萝卜和甘蓝。\n- 用切碎香草、大蒜、盐、胡椒和橄榄油擦拭猪柳。在热锅中煎猪柳各面，然后将其移到烤箱烤至完成烹饪。同时，用橄榄油、盐和胡椒拌土豆、胡萝卜和甘蓝，烤至金黄酥软。\n\n甜点：草莓奶酪杯配香草奶油\n- 食材：混合浆果（如草莓、蓝莓、覆盆子）、希腊酸奶、蜂蜜、香草提取物、燕麦片和薄荷叶（可选）。\n- 在杯中层叠混合浆果和蜂蜜、香草提取物调制的希腊酸奶。撒上一些燕麦片增加脆脆口感，如果愿意，用薄荷叶装饰。这是一款清新、清淡的甜点选择。\n\n这些菜肴准备起来相对简单，口味和口感丰富多样。如果您喜欢这些建议，或者想要更多选择或针对任何菜肴的具体食谱，请告诉我！",
