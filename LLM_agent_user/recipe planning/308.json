Appetizer: Cheesy Stuffed Mushrooms\n- Ingredients: Button mushrooms, cream cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese, garlic, breadcrumbs, parsley, salt, and pepper.\n- This appetizer is easy to make and always a crowd-pleaser. The mushrooms are stuffed with a creamy cheese mixture, then baked until golden and bubbly.\n\n2. Main Course: Classic Chicken Parmesan\n- Ingredients: Chicken breasts, eggs, breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, marinara sauce, mozzarella cheese, spaghetti (optional for serving).\n- Chicken Parmesan is a classic dish that's both delicious and satisfying. It involves breading and frying chicken breasts, then topping them with marinara sauce and melted cheese. Serve it with spaghetti on the side if you'd like.\n\n3. Dessert: Apple Crumble\n- Ingredients: Apples, sugar, flour, oats, butter, cinnamon, and nutmeg.\n- For dessert, an apple crumble is a comforting and easy-to-make choice. Simply combine sliced apples with sugar and spices, then top with a crumbly mixture of flour, oats, and butter. Bake until the apples are tender and the topping is golden brown.\n\nThese dishes should give you a good balance of flavors and textures.

Cheesy Stuffed Mushrooms:\n- Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).\n- Clean the button mushrooms and remove the stems. Set aside the mushroom caps.\n- In a bowl, mix together cream cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese, minced garlic, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper.\n- Fill each mushroom cap with the cheese mixture and place them on a baking sheet.\n- Sprinkle breadcrumbs on top of the stuffed mushrooms.\n- Bake for about 20 minutes or until the mushrooms are tender and the cheese is melted and golden.\n\n2. Classic Chicken Parmesan:\n- Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).\n- Pound the chicken breasts to an even thickness, then season them with salt and pepper.\n- In one bowl, beat a couple of eggs. In another bowl, combine breadcrumbs and grated Parmesan cheese.\n- Dip each chicken breast into the beaten eggs, then coat them with the breadcrumb mixture.\n- Heat some oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook the chicken breasts until they are golden brown on both sides.\n- Place the cooked chicken breasts in a baking dish, cover them with marinara sauce, and top with slices of mozzarella cheese.\n- Bake for about 20-25 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the cheese is melted and bubbly.\n\n3. Apple Crumble:\n- Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).\n- Peel, core, and slice the apples.\n- In a bowl, combine the sliced apples, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Mix well.\n- In a separate bowl, mix together flour, oats, sugar, and softened butter until it forms a crumbly texture.\n- Place the apple mixture in a baking dish and sprinkle the crumble mixture evenly over the top.\n- Bake for about 30-35 minutes or until the apples are tender and the crumble topping is golden brown.\n\nIn terms of order, you can start by preparing the Cheesy Stuffed Mushrooms first, as they can be baked and kept warm while you work on the other dishes. Then move on to the Classic Chicken Parmesan, as it requires some stovetop cooking and oven baking. Finally, prepare the Apple Crumble, as it can bake while you enjoy your main course.\n\nRemember to allocate enough time for each dish, and feel free to ask if you have any further questions or need more details on any specific step!",
            "content_zh": "当然！以下是每道菜的准备过程细节和建议的制作顺序：\n1. 芝士填充蘑菇：\n- 将烤箱预热至375°F（190°C）。\n- 清洁蘑菇并去茎，将蘑菇帽放在一边。\n- 在一个碗中，混合奶油奶酪、切碎的马苏里拉奶酪、捣碎大蒜、切碎的欧芹、盐和胡椒。 \n- 将芝士混合物填入每个蘑菇帽中，然后将它们放在烤盘上。\n- 在填充蘑菇上撒上面包屑。\n- 烘烤约20分钟，或直到蘑菇变软且芝士融化呈金黄色。\n\n2. 经典意大利鸡排：\n- 将烤箱预热至375°F（190°C）。\n- 把鸡胸肉捶成均匀厚度，撒上盐和胡椒。\n- 在一个碗中打几个鸡蛋。在另一个碗中，混合面包屑和磨碎的帕玛森奶酪。\n- 将每块鸡胸肉浸入打了的蛋液中，然后裹上面包屑混合物。\n- 在中火烧热锅中加入一些油，将鸡胸肉两面煎至金黄色。\n- 将煮熟的鸡胸肉放入烤盘中，盖上番茄酱，放上马苏里拉奶酪片。\n- 烤约20-25分钟，或直到鸡肉煮熟，芝士融化起泡。\n\n3. 苹果脆皮：\n- 将烤箱预热至375°F（190°C）。\n- 削皮、去核并切片苹果。\n- 在一个碗中，把切片的苹果、糖、肉桂和豆蔻混合在一起。搅拌均匀。\n- 在另一个碗里，将面粉、燕麦片、糖和软化的黄油混合在一起，直至形成粗糙的质地。\n- 将苹果混合物放入烤盘中，均匀撒上脆皮混合物。\n- 烤约30-35分钟，或直到苹果变软且表面金黄。\n\n在制作顺序方面，您可以先准备芝士填充蘑菇，因为可以先烤好并保持温暖，然后再制作经典意大利鸡排，因为需要一些炉灶和烤箱烹饪。最后制作苹果脆皮，因为它可以在您享用主菜时烘焙。\n请记得为每道菜安排足够的时间，并在任何具体步骤上有进一步问题或需要更多细节时请随时询问！",
