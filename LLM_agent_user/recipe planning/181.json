            "content": "I'm thrilled that you're excited about the meal! Here are the complete recipes for each dish, along with the ingredients needed:\n\nAppetizer: Roasted Beet and Orange Salad with Citrus Dressing\n\nIngredients:\n- 3 medium-sized beets, peeled and cubed\n- 2 oranges, segmented\n- 1/4 cup walnuts, toasted and roughly chopped\n- 4 cups mixed salad greens\n- 1/4 cup fresh orange juice\n- 2 tablespoons lemon juice\n- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n- 1 tablespoon maple syrup\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n\nPreparation:\n1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).\n2. Toss the beet cubes with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper. Place them on a baking sheet and roast for about 25-30 minutes, or until tender.\n3. In a small bowl, whisk together the orange juice, lemon juice, olive oil, maple syrup, salt, and pepper to make the citrus dressing.\n4. In a large salad bowl, combine the roasted beets, orange segments, walnuts, and mixed salad greens. Drizzle the citrus dressing over the salad and gently toss to coat. Adjust the seasoning if needed.\n\nMain Course: Stuffed Portobello Mushrooms with Quinoa and Spinach\n\nIngredients:\n- 4 large portobello mushrooms, stems removed\n- 1 cup cooked quinoa\n- 2 cups fresh spinach, chopped\n- 1 small onion, finely chopped\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast (optional)\n- 1 teaspoon dried thyme\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n\nPreparation:\n1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).\n2. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and sauté until softened.\n3. Add the spinach to the skillet and cook until wilted. Season with salt, pepper, and dried thyme.\n4. In a mixing bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, sautéed spinach mixture, and nutritional yeast. Mix well.\n5. Place the portobello mushrooms on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Fill each mushroom cap with the quinoa and spinach mixture.\n6. Bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until the mushrooms are tender and the filling is heated through.\n\nDessert: Vegan Chocolate Mousse with Raspberry Coulis\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 can (14 oz) full-fat coconut milk, refrigerated overnight\n- 1/4 cup cocoa powder\n- 1/4 cup maple syrup or agave nectar\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n- Fresh raspberries for garnish\n\nRaspberry Coulis:\n- 1 cup fresh or frozen raspberries\n- 2 tablespoons maple syrup or agave nectar\n- 1 tablespoon lemon juice\n\nPreparation:\n1. Open the chilled can of coconut milk and scoop out the solid coconut cream into a mixing bowl, leaving behind the liquid.\n2. Using an electric mixer, beat the coconut cream until smooth and fluffy.\n3. Add cocoa powder, maple syrup, and vanilla extract to the bowl. Beat until well combined and creamy.\n4. Transfer the mousse to serving glasses or bowls and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to set.\n5. For the raspberry coulis, blend the raspberries, maple syrup, and lemon juice in a blender until smooth. Strain the mixture to remove any seeds.\n6. To serve, drizzle the raspberry coulis over the chilled chocolate mousse and garnish with fresh raspberries.\n\nIn terms of the order of preparation, I would suggest starting with the roasted beets for the salad, as they will take the longest time to cook. While the beets are roasting, you can prepare the quinoa and spinach mixture for the stuffed mushrooms. Once the beets are done, you can assemble the salad and set it aside. Finally, prepare the chocolate mousse and raspberry coulis, allowing them to chill in the refrigerator while you enjoy the other courses.\n\nI hope you have a fantastic time preparing and enjoying this special meal with your loved one!
