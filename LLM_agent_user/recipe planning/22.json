            "content": "You're welcome! I'm glad you liked the suggestions. Now, let's talk about the order of preparation for your three-course meal.\n\nTo ensure a smooth flow and timely serving, it's generally a good idea to start with the dish that requires the least amount of last-minute preparation. In this case, that would be the appetizer, bruschetta.\n\nHere's a suggested order for preparation:\n\n1. Appetizer - Bruschetta:\n   - Preparing the bruschetta can be done ahead of time. You can slice the baguette, chop the tomatoes and basil, and mix the olive oil, garlic, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper for the topping. Assemble the bruschetta just before serving or shortly beforehand to keep the bread from getting soggy.\n\n2. Main Course - Grilled Chicken:\n   - Marinate the chicken in the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt, pepper, and any additional herbs or spices you'd like to add. It's best to marinate the chicken for at least 30 minutes or up to a few hours to enhance the flavor.\n   - While the chicken is marinating, you can prepare any side dishes you'd like to serve with it, such as roasted vegetables or a salad.\n   - When it's time to cook, you can grill the chicken. Make sure to preheat the grill and cook the chicken until it reaches the appropriate internal temperature, usually around 165°F (74°C) for chicken breasts.\n\n3. Dessert - Chocolate Mousse:\n   - Chocolate mousse is a dessert that needs some time to set. It's best to prepare it ahead of time, at least a few hours before your guests arrive or even the day before. This will give it enough time to chill and firm up in the refrigerator.\n   - Once the mousse is ready, you can divide it into individual serving dishes or glasses and garnish with whipped cream and fresh berries just before serving.\n\nBy following this order, you'll have the appetizer ready to be enjoyed as soon as your guests arrive, the main course cooked to perfection, and the dessert nicely chilled and ready for a sweet ending to the meal.",
            "content_zh": "不客气！我很高兴你喜欢这些建议。现在，让我们来谈一谈你的三道菜准备顺序。为了确保顺畅的流程和及时的上菜，通常最好先从需要最少即时准备的菜品开始。在这种情况下，那将是开胃菜，意式烤面包片。以下是准备建议顺序：1. 开胃菜-意式烤面包片：- 意式烤面包片可以事先准备好。你可以切片法棍面包，切碎番茄和罗勒，混合橄榄油、大蒜、香醋、盐和胡椒作为顶部的配料。在上菜前或不久之前组合意式烤面包片，以免面包变得湿软。2. 主菜-烤鸡：- 用橄榄油、柠檬汁、大蒜、盐、胡椒和任何额外的香草或香料腌制鸡肉。最好腌制鸡肉至少30分钟或几个小时以增强味道。- 当鸡肉在腌制时，你可以准备任何你想跟它一起上菜的配菜，比如烤蔬菜或沙拉。- 下厨时，你可以烤鸡肉。确保提前预热烤架，将鸡烤至达到适当的内部温度，通常鸡胸部应在165°F（74°C）左右。3. 甜点-巧克力慕斯：- 巧克力慕斯是需要一些时间凝固的甜点。最好事先准备好，至少在客人到达前几个小时甚至前一天。这样会给它足够的时间在冰箱里冷却和凝固。- 一旦慕斯准备好，你可以把它分成单人份的容器或玻璃杯，然后在上菜前撒上打发奶油和新鲜浆果。通过遵循这个顺序，你会有开胃菜准备好让客人一到就享用，主菜煮得恰到好处，甜点冷冻得宜，准备好为整顿餐的美好结尾。",
