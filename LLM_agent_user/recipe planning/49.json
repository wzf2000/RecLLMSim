Your menu choices sound fantastic, and I'm sure your friends will enjoy them.\n\nWhen it comes to the order of preparation, here's a suggested plan:\n\n1. Start with the appetizers since they are usually served first. You can prepare the Mini Caprese Skewers and Bacon-Wrapped Dates in advance and assemble them just before your guests arrive. This way, they'll be fresh and ready to enjoy.\n\n2. Move on to the sides. While the main course is cooking, you can roast the Brussels sprouts and prepare the balsamic glaze. Then, make the garlic mashed potatoes and keep them warm until serving. Finally, grill the asparagus right before you're ready to serve the meal.\n\n3. Next, focus on the main course. Prepare the herb crust for the rack of lamb and set it aside. When you're ready, roast the lamb in the oven until it reaches your desired level of doneness. While the lamb is resting, you can start making the mushroom risotto on the stovetop. This way, the risotto will be creamy and ready to serve alongside the lamb.\n\n4. Finally, prepare the desserts. You can make the Mini Cheesecakes ahead of time and refrigerate them until serving. Just before dessert time, arrange the fresh fruit platter and set up the chocolate fondue for dipping.\n\nBy following this order, you can ensure that everything is prepared and served at its best. It allows you to focus on each dish without feeling overwhelmed. Remember to plan your cooking and prep time accordingly, and don't hesitate to ask for help if needed.\n\nI hope your birthday celebration turns out to be a memorable and delicious one! Enjoy the cooking process and have a wonderful time with your friends!",
            "content_zh": "非常欢迎！我很高兴你喜欢这些建议。你的菜单选择听起来很棒，我相信你的朋友们会喜欢它们。\n\n关于准备顺序，这里有一个建议的计划：\n\n1. 从开胃菜开始，因为它们通常是最先上桌的。你可以提前准备小牛排番茄串和培根包裹的无核乌枣，然后在客人到达之前组装它们。这样，它们会是新鲜的，准备就绪。\n\n2. 接着做配菜。当主菜在烹饪时，你可以烤一下甜甜菜和准备好意大利香醋汁。然后做大蒜土豆泥，保持温暖直到上菜。最后，在准备上菜前烤一下芦笋。\n\n3. 接着，专注于主菜。为羔羊排准备香草外壳并放在一旁。当你准备好时，将羊肉在烤箱中烤到你所需的熟度。当羊肉在休息时，你可以在灶台上开始制作蘑菇烩饭。这样，烩饭将会奶香十足，准备好与羊肉一起上桌。\n\n4. 最后，准备甜点。你可以提前制作迷你芝士蛋糕并冷藏至上菜。正好在甜点时间前，摆好新鲜水果拼盘并准备巧克力火锅\n\n通过遵循这个顺序，你可以确保一切都在最佳状态下准备和上桌。这样可以让你专注于每道菜，而不感到不知所措。记得根据自己的烹饪和准备时间做好计划，并在需要时不要犹豫寻求帮助。\n\n我希望你的生日庆祝活动会是一个令人难忘且美味的时刻！享受烹饪的过程，和朋友们度过愉快的时光！",
