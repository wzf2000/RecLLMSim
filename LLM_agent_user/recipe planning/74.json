Serve the chicken in warm tortillas with shredded cabbage, pickled carrots, and a drizzle of spicy Sriracha mayo.\n\nSide Dish:\n- Asian Slaw: Toss together shredded Napa cabbage, julienned bell peppers, sliced scallions, and toasted sesame seeds. Dress with a tangy dressing made from rice vinegar, soy sauce, honey, and a touch of sesame oil.\n\nDessert:\n- Green Tea Tres Leches Cake: Prepare a classic tres leches cake, but infuse the milk mixture with green tea for a unique twist. Top with whipped cream and a sprinkle of matcha powder.\n\nBeverage:\n- Lychee Margarita: Blend lychee fruit, lime juice, tequila, and a splash of agave syrup with ice. Serve in salt-rimmed glasses garnished with a lychee fruit.\n\nFeel free to adjust and customize these ideas to your liking.
