Planning and Preparation: Make a detailed shopping list of all the ingredients you'll need for the recipes.

Additionally, consider prepping some ingredients in advance, like marinating the chicken or making the mango salsa a day ahead, to save time on the day of the celebration.\n\n2. Timing and Coordination: Think about the order in which you'll prepare and cook the dishes. Start with the appetizers and sides that can be made ahead or require minimal cooking. Then move on to the main course dishes, which may require more attention and timing. Lastly, prepare the desserts closer to the time you plan to serve them for optimal freshness.\n\n3. Presentation: Pay attention to the presentation of the dishes. Garnish plates with fresh herbs or a sprinkle of spices to add a pop of color. You can also consider using decorative platters or serving dishes to make the meal feel more special.\n\n4. Dietary Considerations: If any of your friends have specific dietary restrictions or allergies, make sure to label the dishes accordingly or provide alternative options. It's always thoughtful to accommodate everyone's needs and preferences.\n\n5. Enjoy the Process: Cooking and hosting can be a lot of fun, so remember to enjoy the process. Don't be afraid to ask for help from your friends if they're willing to lend a hand.
