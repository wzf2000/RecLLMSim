Side Salad: A refreshing side salad can add some crunch and freshness to your meal. You can make a simple green salad with mixed lettuce, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, and a light vinaigrette dressing. Or if you're feeling adventurous, you could try a Greek salad with feta cheese, olives, and a lemon-herb dressing.\n\n2. Garlic Roasted Potatoes: Another delicious option is to make garlic roasted potatoes. Chop some potatoes into bite-sized pieces, toss them with olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Spread them on a baking sheet and roast at 425°F (220°C) for about 25-30 minutes until they're golden and crispy. This side dish pairs well with the stuffed bell peppers and adds a comforting element to the meal.\n\nFeel free to choose the option that appeals to you the most or try both if you're feeling adventurous.
