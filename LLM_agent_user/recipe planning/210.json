Season the steaks generously with salt and pepper on both sides.\n2. Heat the olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.\n3. Once the skillet is hot, add the steaks and cook for about 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare (adjust cooking time based on your preference).\n4. Remove the steaks from the skillet and let them rest on a plate while you prepare the sauce.\n5. In the same skillet, add the sliced mushrooms and garlic. Sauté until the mushrooms are browned and tender.\n6. Pour in the red wine and let it simmer for a minute or two to reduce slightly.\n7. Add the broth and Dijon mustard to the skillet, stirring well to combine. Let the sauce simmer for a few minutes until it thickens slightly.\n8. Return the steaks to the skillet, spooning the sauce over them. Cook for an additional minute to reheat the steaks.\n9. Remove the steaks from the skillet and let them rest for a few minutes before serving.\n10. Optionally, garnish with fresh herbs before serving.\n\nFor side dishes, you could consider serving roasted potatoes or a creamy mashed potato dish. Additionally, a simple green salad or steamed vegetables would complement the steak nicely. And don't forget to pair the meal with a good bottle of red wine or your preferred beverage!\n\nI hope this recipe idea helps you create a memorable meal for your friends.
