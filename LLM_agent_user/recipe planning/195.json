Simmer until the shrimp is cooked through, and then add bell peppers, snap peas, bamboo shoots, and basil leaves. Serve with steamed rice or noodles.\n\nDessert: Lemon-Lavender Crème Brûlée\n- Ingredients: Heavy cream, sugar, lemon zest, dried lavender, egg yolks, and granulated sugar for caramelizing.\n- Instructions: Infuse the cream with lemon zest and dried lavender. Whisk together egg yolks and sugar, then slowly pour in the infused cream. Pour the mixture into ramekins and bake in a water bath until set. Once chilled, sprinkle granulated sugar on top and caramelize with a kitchen torch.\n\nThese dishes should provide a unique and flavorful experience for your special meal.

Now, let's discuss a few additional details to ensure your meal preparation goes smoothly:\n\n1. Timing: Consider how long each dish will take to prepare and plan accordingly. You don't want to feel rushed or overwhelmed. It's a good idea to prepare some components in advance, such as the mango salsa or the infused cream for the crème brûlée.\n\n2. Presentation: To make the meal more visually appealing, think about garnishing the dishes. For example, you can add a sprig of fresh herbs or a drizzle of sauce on top of the scallops or curry. Dusting the crème brûlée with powdered sugar and garnishing with a lemon twist or lavender sprig would also be lovely.\n\n3. Atmosphere: Consider setting the mood for your special meal. Dim the lights, light some candles, and play some soft music in the background. Creating a cozy and intimate ambiance will enhance the overall experience.\n\n4. Wine Pairing: If you and your loved one enjoy wine, you might want to consider pairing a suitable wine with each course. For example, a crisp white wine like Sauvignon Blanc or Chardonnay can complement the scallops, while a light-bodied red like Pinot Noir can go well with the Thai curry. For the dessert, a sweet wine like a late-harvest Riesling or a sparkling Moscato would be delightful.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to enjoy the process and have fun while preparing this special meal. I wish you and your loved one a fantastic dining experience filled with delicious food and beautiful memories! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.",
