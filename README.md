# To What Extent Can LLMs Assist in User Simulation for Task-Oriented Conversations

## Data

We provide all the data files under the `real_human_user` and `LLM_simulated` folder.

The conversation dataset is divided into several parts according to the task and the user. Each conversation is stored in a `.json` file under the corresponding task folder.

The format of the `.json` file is:
```json
{
    "task": "The name of the task for this conversation.",
    "preference_id": "The ID of the user profile used in this conversation.",
    "task_context_id": "The ID of the task description used in this conversation.",
    "preference": "Preference used in this conversation.",
    "preference_zh": "Preference used in this conversation translated in Chinese.",
    "task_context": "The scenario-specific task description used in this conversation",
    "task_context_zh": "The scenario-specific task description used in this conversation translated in Chinese.",
    "history": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Some text generated by user simulator LLM.",
            "content_zh": "Some text generated by user simulator LLM translated in Chinese.",
            "intent": "The intent annotation of the user simulator LLM.",
            "intent_zh": "The intent annotation of the user simulator LLM translated in Chinese.",
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Some text generated by assistant LLM.",
            "content_zh": "Some text generated by assistant LLM translated in Chinese.",
            "hallucination": {
                "hallucination": "Whether the assistant hallucinates in this turn.",
                "memo": "The memo of the hallucination.",
            },
        },
        // ...
    ],
    "conflict": false,
    "preference_summary": "The summary of the user simulator's preference extracted from the conversation.",
    "rating": {
        // Some rating information.
    },
    // Some other information.
}
```

## User Simulator Framework

We provide the code for the framework in the `RecUserSim` folder.

Check the `readme.md` file in the `RecUserSim` folder for more details.
