# Human Vs. Agent in Task-Oriented Conversations

## Data

We provide all the data files under the `real_human_user`, `human_exp_V2` and `LLM_agent_user` folder.

The conversation dataset is divided into several parts according to the task and the user. Each conversation is stored in a `.json` file under the corresponding task folder.

The format of the `.json` file is:
```json
{
    "history": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Some text generated by user simulator LLM.",
            "content_zh": "Some text generated by user simulator LLM translated in Chinese (for agent users only).",
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Some text generated by assistant LLM.",
            "content_zh": "Some text generated by assistant LLM translated in Chinese (for agent users only).",
            "hallucination": "Whether the assistant hallucinates in this turn.",
        },
        // ...
    ],
    "preference/profile/profile_mapped": "Preference used in this conversation.",
    "preference_id": "The ID of the user profile used in this conversation (for agent users only).",
    "preference_zh": "Preference used in this conversation translated in Chinese (for agent users only).",
    "strategy_Vx": "User behavior analysis results, where x is the version number.",
    "strategy_human_Vx": "User behavior analysis results from human annotators, where x is the version number.",
    "task/task_type": "The name of the task for this conversation.",
    "task_context": "The scenario-specific task description used in this conversation",
    "task_context_id": "The ID of the task description used in this conversation (for agent users only).",
    "task_context_zh": "The scenario-specific task description used in this conversation translated in Chinese (for agent users only).",
    // Some other information, including user behavior analysis, chat model, etc.
}
```

## User Simulator Framework

We provide the code for the framework in the `RecUserSim` folder.

Check the `readme.md` file in the `RecUserSim` folder for more details.

## File Structure

- `real_human_user`/`human_exp_V2`: The conversation data constructed from real human users.
- `LLM_agent_user`: The conversation data constructed by the LLM agent users.
- `RecUserSim`: The code for the user simulator framework.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `user_behavior`: Automatically label method for user behavior analysis.
- `statistics`: The code for the statistics of the dataset.
