# Task-based Recommendation Conversation Generation with LLMs

A dataset for task-based recommendation conversation.

## Raw Data

We provide original conversation data files in both Chinese and English under the `raw_data` folder.

The format of the `.json` file is:
```json
[
    {
        "preference": "Preference used in this conversation",
        "task_context": "The scenario-specific task description used in this conversation",
        "history": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Some text generated by simulation ChatGPT."
            },
            {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": "Some text generated by assistant ChatGPT."
            },
            // ...
        ],
        "post_questions": [
            "assistant": [
                {
                    "query": "Post question description.",
                    "response": "The response to the question."
                },
                // ...
            ],
            "user": [
                {
                    "query": "Post question description.",
                    "response": "The response to the question."
                },
