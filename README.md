# RecLLMSim: A Task-based Recommendation Conversation Dataset

A dataset for task-based recommendation conversation.

## Raw Data

We provide original conversation data files in both Chinese and English under the `raw_data` folder.

The format of the `.json` file is:
```json
[
    {
        "preference": "Preference used in this conversation",
        "task_context": "The scenario-specific task description used in this conversation",
        "history": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Some text generated by simulation ChatGPT."
            },
            {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": "Some text generated by assistant ChatGPT."
            },
            // ...
        ],
        "post_questions": [
            "assistant": [
                {
                    "query": "Post question description.",
                    "response": "The response to the question."
                },
                // ...
            ],
            "user": [
                {
                    "query": "Post question description.",
                    "response": "The response to the question."
                },
                // ...
            ]
        ],
        "task_type": "The type of the task for this conversation."
    },
    // ...
]
```

## Filtered Data

We provide manually labeled and filtered conversation data files in both Chinese and English under the `filtered_data` folder. All data marked as `drop: true` is dropped. In addition to the annotation, we also removed all statements with the "[System]: XXX" style at the end of an utterance.

The format of the `.json` file is similar to raw data but add `label` for every data sample:

```json
[
    {
        // similar to the above...
        "label" : {
            "complete": 0 // 0, 1, 2 stand for imcomplete, partially complete and complete respectively
        }
    }
]
```

## Labeled Data

We also provide all the data with labels under the `labeled_data` folder.
