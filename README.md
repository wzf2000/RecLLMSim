# RecLLMSim: A Task-based Recommendation Conversation Dataset

A dataset for task-based recommendation conversation.

## Data Format

We provide all the data files under the `V2` folder.

The conversation dataset is divided into several parts according to the task. Each conversation is stored in a `.json` file under the corresponding task folder.

```json
