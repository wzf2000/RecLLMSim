Walking allows you to soak in the atmosphere, discover hidden gems, and truly experience the charm of the city.\n\n2.

Buses and trams can be convenient for reaching specific neighborhoods or attractions not served by the metro.\n\n3.

These buses follow specific routes and allow you to get on and off at various attractions at your own pace.\n\n4. Taxis and Ride-Sharing: Taxis are widely available in Rome, and ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft operate in the city as well. Taxis can be convenient for shorter trips or if you prefer a door-to-door service, but keep in mind that traffic in Rome can be quite congested at times.\n\nIt's worth noting that some areas in the Historic Center are pedestrian-only zones, so public transportation or taxis may be necessary to reach certain attractions.
