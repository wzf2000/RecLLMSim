You can find luxury hotels, boutique guesthouses, budget hostels, and even unique homestays. Websites like Booking.com, Agoda, and Airbnb can help you find suitable accommodations based on your preferences and budget.\n\nWhen planning your itinerary, consider spending a few days in each destination to truly immerse yourself in the local culture and explore the surroundings.
