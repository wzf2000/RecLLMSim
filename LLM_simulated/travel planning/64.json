It's a magical experience in the winter.\n- End your day by relaxing at the Banff Upper Hot Springs, where you can soak in the warm mineral-rich waters while enjoying the surrounding mountain views.\n\nDay 2:\n- Start your day by driving along the Icefields Parkway, one of the most scenic drives in the world.
