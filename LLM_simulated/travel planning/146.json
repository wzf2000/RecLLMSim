I have a few suggestions that I think you might enjoy. How about exploring the beautiful landscapes of the Pacific Northwest?\n\nDay 1:\nStart your trip by flying into Portland, Oregon. From there, you can rent a car and head towards the Columbia River Gorge. This scenic area offers numerous hiking trails with breathtaking waterfalls, such as Multnomah Falls and Wahclella Falls. Spend the day hiking and enjoying the natural beauty of the gorge.\n\nFor accommodation, consider camping at one of the nearby campgrounds or staying at a budget-friendly hotel in the area.\n\nDay 2:\nOn the second day, drive about two hours east to Mount Hood National Forest. Here, you'll find picturesque trails, including the popular Timberline Trail. If you're up for a challenge, you can hike a portion of the Pacific Crest Trail, which offers stunning views of the surrounding mountains.\n\nAfter a day of hiking, you can relax at Trillium Lake, located near Mount Hood. It's a tranquil spot where you can unwind, read a book, and enjoy the scenic beauty.\n\nFor the second night, you can either camp at one of the campgrounds in the national forest or find a cozy cabin or budget-friendly accommodation nearby.\n\nThese two days will give you a taste of the Pacific Northwest's natural beauty, and you'll have the opportunity to enjoy hiking, camping, and peaceful surroundings. Plus, the frugal approach will help keep your budget in check.\n\nLet me know if this sounds like a plan, or if you have any other preferences or questions!",
