Hotel Neri Relais & Châteaux is a boutique hotel located in the heart of the Gothic Quarter, known for its luxurious rooms and excellent service. Another great option is Mercer Hotel Barcelona, a five-star hotel housed in a restored medieval building.\n\nIn Rome, the Trastevere neighborhood is a popular choice for its lively atmosphere and local charm. Hotel Santa Maria is a cozy boutique hotel located in Trastevere, known for its friendly staff and peaceful courtyard. For a more luxurious option, consider Hotel de Russie, located near the Spanish Steps. It offers elegant rooms and a beautiful garden where you can unwind after a day of exploring.\n\nThese are just a couple of options to consider, but there are many more accommodations available in both cities. I recommend checking out travel websites like Booking.com or Airbnb to find the best deals and read reviews from other travelers.

Now, let's discuss transportation between Barcelona and Rome.\n\nGiven the distance between the two cities, the most convenient option would be to take a flight. Several airlines offer direct flights between Barcelona and Rome, and the journey takes around 2 hours. It's a quick and efficient way to travel, allowing you to maximize your time at each destination.\n\nTo find the most affordable flights, I recommend using flight comparison websites like Skyscanner or Kayak. They allow you to compare prices from different airlines and find the best deals. It's also worth checking the websites of low-cost carriers like Ryanair or easyJet, as they often offer competitive prices for short-haul flights within Europe.\n\nIf you prefer a more scenic and leisurely option, you could also consider taking a train. However, keep in mind that the journey is quite long, taking around 12-14 hours with multiple transfers. It can be a more comfortable and enjoyable experience if you prefer watching the landscapes pass by, but it's important to factor in the longer travel time.\n\nUltimately, the choice between flying and taking the train depends on your personal preferences, budget, and the amount of time you have available.
