The flight duration can vary depending on the layover, but it typically takes around 15-20 hours in total.\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer a more scenic and immersive experience, you can consider taking the train. The journey from Paris to Kyoto would involve a combination of high-speed trains and local trains. You'd travel from Paris to a major European hub like Frankfurt or Zurich by high-speed train, then take a flight to Tokyo, and finally, board a bullet train (Shinkansen) from Tokyo to Kyoto. This option would take longer, around 2-3 days, but it allows you to experience different landscapes and cultures along the way.\n\nConsidering the time constraints of your trip, flying would be the more practical choice, as it would save you valuable time.
