Flight: Taking a flight is the fastest and most convenient option. Look for direct flights from Barcelona to Bangkok, which are usually available with several airlines. Consider comparing prices on different flight search engines to find the best deals.\n\n2. Layover: If you're open to a longer travel time but want to save on costs, you can look for flights with layovers. Connecting flights might have layovers in cities like Dubai, Doha, or Istanbul. Just keep in mind that this will extend your travel time.\n\n3. Overland and Air Combination: If you're interested in a more adventurous journey, you could consider combining overland travel with a flight. For example, you could take a train or bus from Barcelona to a European city with good flight connections to Bangkok, such as Paris or Frankfurt, and then fly to Bangkok from there.\n\n4. Round-the-World Ticket: If you plan to visit multiple destinations during your trip, you might want to explore the option of a round-the-world ticket. These tickets allow you to visit several cities across different continents at a fixed price, which can be more cost-effective than booking individual flights.\n\nRemember to compare prices, check for any visa requirements or travel restrictions, and consider the duration and convenience of each option before making a decision.
