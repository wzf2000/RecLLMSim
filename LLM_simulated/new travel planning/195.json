It's also conveniently located near downtown Ashland, making it an ideal choice.\n\n**Hiking:** The trails in Lithia Park are relatively moderate and perfect for a relaxing hike. For your day on Mount Ashland, the **Bull Gap Trail** is a good choice. It's rated as moderate, with a gradual incline and beautiful views.\n\n**Weather:** In December, you can expect temperatures to range from the mid-30s to mid-40s Fahrenheit in Ashland. It's usually quite wet, with a high chance of rain and occasionally snow. So, waterproof hiking boots, warm layers, and a waterproof jacket would be essential.\n\n**Dining:** For a taste of local Oregon cuisine, I recommend **Alchemy Restaurant and Bar**. While not exclusively vegan, they offer a variety of locally-sourced dishes and have vegan options on their menu.\n\n**Pet-Friendly Cafes:** Unfortunately, due to health codes, most cafes in Ashland don't allow pets inside unless they're service animals.
