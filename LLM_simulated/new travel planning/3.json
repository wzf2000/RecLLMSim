Here are some budget-friendly accommodations and tips for enjoying the Vegas nightlife:\n\n**Accommodations:**\n\n1. **The LINQ Hotel + Experience**: Centrally located on the Strip, The LINQ offers budget-friendly rooms and is home to the High Roller, the world's tallest observation wheel.\n\n2. **Excalibur Hotel & Casino**: Another budget-friendly option on the Strip, Excalibur offers a castle-themed resort with multiple entertainment options.\n\n3. **Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel & Casino**: This is a classic Vegas hotel with reasonable prices. It's situated right in the heart of the Strip, making it convenient to get to other locations.\n\n4. **Hostel Cat**: If you're really on a tight budget, this hostel is one of the best-rated in Vegas. It's a bit off the Strip, but they offer free shuttles to the main attractions.\n\n**Nightlife and Parties:**\n\nLas Vegas is known for its world-class nightclubs, many of which feature major international DJs. While specific events for December might not be announced yet, here are some popular venues to keep an eye on:\n\n1. **Hakkasan at MGM Grand**: One of the biggest clubs in Vegas, Hakkasan regularly hosts famous DJs.\n\n2. **Omnia at Caesars Palace**: This is another top-tier club. The main room often features EDM DJs, while the Heart of Omnia room plays hip-hop and top 40 hits.\n\n3. **XS at Wynn/Encore**: XS is one of the most luxurious clubs in Vegas, known for hosting popular DJs and artists.\n\n4. **Marquee at The Cosmopolitan**: Marquee is a multi-level venue with an outdoor area that offers great views of the Strip.\n\n5. **Daylight at Mandalay Bay**: If you're looking for a daytime party, Daylight is one of the most popular pool parties in Vegas.\n\nKeep in mind that while these clubs are a lot of fun, drinks can be quite pricey. Pre-gaming in your hotel room can help save some money. Also, consider purchasing tickets to events in advance online, as prices often go up at the door. Websites like Vegas.com or direct club websites are good resources for event schedules and tickets.\n\n**Other Tips:**\n\n- Remember to factor in the cost of parking if you're driving. Some hotels charge daily rates for parking.\n- Keep hydrated and take care of yourselves. Vegas can be overwhelming with all the constant activity.\n\nOnce you get closer to your travel dates, I recommend checking specific event schedules at these clubs, as they'll begin to announce their December lineups.

Ensure you have all your essentials packed, including ID for club entry and any tickets you've pre-purchased for events.\n- **Evening:** Arrive in Las Vegas and check into the Excalibur Hotel & Casino. Take some time to settle in and perhaps grab a quick bite to eat at one of the hotel's casual dining spots.\n- **Night:** Pre-game in your hotel room to save on drinks later. Then, head out to explore the Strip. You could walk around, enjoy the free outdoor shows such as the Bellagio Fountains, and soak in the Vegas atmosphere.\n- **Late Night:** Choose a club for the evening and enjoy the nightlife. Remember to stay hydrated and stick together as a group.\n\n**Saturday:**\n\n- **Morning:** Sleep in after a late night out. Then have a leisurely breakfast or brunch at one of the Strip's many eateries. Some places offer buffet options which can be a good value.\n- **Afternoon:** Visit some of the iconic hotels and their attractions. The Venetian has beautiful canals and gondola rides, and the Paris Las Vegas has the Eiffel Tower Experience with great views.\n- **Late Afternoon:** Relax by the Excalibur pool or try your luck at the casino. This would be a good time to have some downtime before another night out.\n- **Evening:** Have dinner at one of the Strip's many restaurants. There are options for every budget and taste.\n- **Night:** Head out to another club or catch a DJ set. If you've pre-booked, make sure to arrive on time to avoid long lines.\n- **Late Night:** If you're up for it, post-clubbing, take a late-night stroll or hit a 24-hour cafe for some late-night eats.\n\n**Sunday:**\n\n- **Morning:** Check out of your hotel but leave your luggage with the bell desk if you want to explore more. Grab a quick breakfast.\n- **Afternoon:** Visit one of the attractions you haven't seen yet, or do some shopping at the many stores and boutiques along the Strip. Another option is to enjoy a relaxing Sunday pool party if the weather permits.\n- **Late Afternoon:** Start your drive back to San Diego. Depending on how the group feels, you can either head straight home or stop along the way for dinner.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n- **Mobility:** Consider the distances on the Strip. It's longer than it looks! If you're short on time or tired from the night before, use the trams, buses, or even ride-shares to get around.\n- **Reservations:** For dinner on Saturday night, it's a good idea to make reservations in advance, especially if you're dining with a group.\n- **Rest:** Don't underestimate the importance of rest. Vegas can be intense, and you'll want to enjoy your nights out, so make sure to take some time to recharge.\n\nThis is just a suggested outline, and you should tailor it to your group's interests and energy levels. Remember to check the exact club lineups and make sure to follow any COVID-19 guidelines or restrictions that may be in place during your visit. Have a fantastic trip to Las Vegas!",
