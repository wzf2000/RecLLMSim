            "content": "Great, thanks for sharing those details! Considering your base in New York City, interest in music and vegan cuisine, and preference for a warmer climate in December, here are a few destination suggestions:\n\n1. **Nashville, Tennessee** - While it's not international, Nashville is known as \"Music City\" and could be a fantastic choice for a music lover. The city is famous for its vibrant country music scene, historic music venues like the Grand Ole Opry and the Ryman Auditorium, and numerous live music bars. Nashville also has a growing vegan scene, with a variety of restaurants catering to plant-based diets.\n\n2. **New Orleans, Louisiana** - Another excellent choice within the U.S. that's renowned for its music, particularly jazz. You could explore the French Quarter, enjoy live music on Frenchmen Street, and visit the New Orleans Jazz Museum. The city also offers a rich culinary culture with an increasing number of vegan-friendly options.\n\n3. **Austin, Texas** - Known as the \"Live Music Capital of the World,\" Austin offers an incredible array of live music venues, alongside an impressive vegan food scene. December is also a great time to enjoy the city's warmer climate. You can explore South Congress Avenue for food and shopping, and maybe catch the Trail of Lights if your trip aligns with this event.\n\n4. **Havana, Cuba** - If you're considering an international destination that's not too far, Havana could be an intriguing option. It's rich in musical history, offering genres like son cubano, salsa, and jazz. The city itself is a UNESCO World Heritage site, with beautiful architecture and a vibrant street life. Vegan food options are more limited than in U.S. cities, but the local cuisine can be explored with some research and flexibility.\n\n5. **Mexico City, Mexico** - As one of the largest cities in the world, Mexico City has an incredibly diverse music scene, from traditional mariachi bands to contemporary artists. The city is also a foodie paradise, with an increasing number of vegan restaurants and markets. Plus, the climate in December is mild and pleasant.\n\nGiven these options and considering your time constraint for a weekend trip, Nashville, New Orleans, and Austin might be the most logistically sensible choices, offering rich music scenes, plenty of vegan dining options, and relatively short flights from New York City. Havana and Mexico City are fantastic for a warmer climate and cultural exploration but might require a bit more travel time.\n\nWould any of these destinations interest you, or do you have another place in mind?",

Kennedy International Airport (JFK), LaGuardia Airport (LGA), and Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR). Your choice might depend on where in the city you live and which airport you prefer. Austin has one major airport, Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (AUS).\n\n3. **Flight Times:** Non-stop flights from New York City to Austin generally take around 4 to 5 hours. Given your preference for leaving on Friday afternoon or evening, you should be able to find a flight that gets you to Austin later in the evening. For your return on Sunday, look for evening flights that get you back to New York City late Sunday night.\n\n4. **Booking Tips:** Use flight comparison websites like Skyscanner, Kayak, or Google Flights to find the best fares and schedules. These sites allow you to set filters for your preferred departure times. Be sure to check if your ticket includes checked luggage if you need it, as some airlines charge extra for this.\n\nOnce you've selected and booked your flights, I can help you find accommodation and suggest some music venues and vegan restaurants in Austin.
