Unfortunately, as an AI, I don't have the capability to make bookings for you. However, you can easily make a reservation on their official website or a trusted booking site like Booking.com or Expedia. I recommend doing this as early as possible to ensure availability.\n\nItinerary: Moving the visit to the Edinburgh Zoo and the Royal Botanic Garden to the first week is a great idea. This adjustment will allow you to have three full days in the Highlands, giving you more time to explore and soak in the natural beauty.\n\nTransportation: Edinburgh has an excellent public transportation system with extensive bus and tram networks. The Lothian Buses service covers most of the city and is likely to be your main mode of transport. For your Highland trip, I would recommend renting a car. This will give you the flexibility to explore more remote areas at your own pace. Companies like Enterprise, Avis, and Hertz have offices in Edinburgh, and you should be able to arrange a pick-up and drop-off that suit your plans.\n\nTo provide a brief summary:\n\nWeek 1:\nDay 1-4: Same as before.\nDay 5: Visit the Edinburgh Zoo or the Royal Botanic Garden.\nDay 6: Day trip to Rosslyn Chapel.\nDay 7: Rest day.

Literature: Check to see if there are any literary events, book readings, or festivals happening during your stay. The Scottish Storytelling Centre often hosts events and could be worth a visit.\n\n4. Stay Connected: If you're planning to use your phone a lot, consider getting a local SIM card for cheaper data. Major providers in the UK include EE, O2, and Vodafone.\n\n5. Scottish Customs: Scotland has a rich cultural heritage. Learning a bit about local customs, history, and a few words in Scots or Gaelic can enhance your experience and connection with the locals.\n\n6. Safety: Edinburgh is generally a safe city, but like any other city, it's important to stay aware of your surroundings, especially at night.\n\nRemember to check all your travel documents, ensure you have travel insurance, and inform your bank about your travel plans. Also, make sure to have all the necessary equipment if you plan to do a lot of hiking, and always check weather conditions before heading out.\n\nEnjoy your trip!
