Given your interests, budget, and location, I have a suggestion that I think you and your buddies would enjoy: Las Vegas, Nevada. It's about a 4-hour drive from Los Angeles, and it's a city that never sleeps. \n\nHere's a rough plan:\n\n**Day 1:**\n- Drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. \n- Check into a budget hotel or hostel. Some options could be \"Sin City Hostel\" or \"The D Las Vegas\". \n- Start the trip with a visit to the famous Las Vegas Strip. Explore casinos, enjoy free shows on the streets, and soak up the vibe of Vegas.\n- End the day with a party at one of the city's famous nightclubs like Hakkasan or Marquee.\n\n**Day 2:**\n- During the day, you can visit the Pinball Hall of Fame, which would appeal to your gaming interest. Entry is free, but you'll need quarters to play the games. \n- In the afternoon, catch a soccer game at the Allegiant Stadium, home of the Las Vegas Lights FC. \n- At night, experience a concert or live music event. Venues like the House of Blues and Brooklyn Bowl often have great acts.\n\n**Day 3:**\n- Spend the day exploring more of the city, or try something adventurous like driving exotic race cars at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway.\n- Drive back to Los Angeles in the evening.\n\nPlease make sure to check the availability and timings of all activities and events, as they can vary. Also, remember to check the current COVID-19 guidelines and restrictions for Las Vegas.\n\nHow does this sound? Would you like more information on any part of this plan?",
