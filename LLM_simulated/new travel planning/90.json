Do you have any travel restrictions or preferences concerning accommodation (e.g., eco-lodges, hostels, luxury hotels)?\n7.

Costa Rica is also known for its commitment to sustainability and has many eco-lodges. The cuisine is simple and healthy, and the culture is friendly and relaxed. As a U.S. passport holder, you can stay in Costa Rica for up to 90 days without a visa.\n\n2. **Australia**: Australia offers a mix of adventures, from the Great Barrier Reef to the Outback. December is the start of summer in Australia, so the weather would be warm. The country is also famous for its unique wildlife, which could be a great addition to your blog. Australia does require a visa for U.S. tourists, but you can easily apply for an Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) online.\n\n3. **South Africa**: South Africa has a diverse range of adventures, from safari tours in Kruger National Park to diving with sharks in Cape Town. The country also has a rich cultural history and delicious cuisine. U.S. citizens can enter South Africa for up to 90 days without a visa.\n\nPlease let me know which destination interests you the most, and I can start drafting a detailed travel plan with attractions, itinerary, accommodation, and transportation.",

Here's a preliminary outline for your two-week trip:\n\n**Travel & Transport:**\n\n1. **Flight**: A round trip flight from Los Angeles to Johannesburg, South Africa, will likely be your most significant expense. There are plenty of options, but expect at least one stopover and a travel duration of approximately 24-30 hours.\n\n2. **Local Transportation**: The best way to explore South Africa is by car. Consider renting a vehicle for the duration of your stay. However, you should be comfortable driving on the left side of the road.\n\n**Accommodations:**\n\n1. **Johannesburg** (3 nights): Start your trip in Johannesburg. Stay at a sustainable hotel such as The Peech Hotel, which is recognized for its eco-friendly initiatives.\n\n2. **Kruger National Park** (4 nights): Consider staying in an eco-friendly lodge like Rhino Post Safari Lodge, which offers sustainable yet luxurious accommodations.\n\n3. **Cape Town** (7 nights): The Backpack is an award-winning, Fair Trade accredited hostel in Cape Town that is known for its eco-friendly practices.\n\n**Itinerary:**\n\n1. **Johannesburg** (Days 1-3): Visit the Apartheid Museum and Constitution Hill to understand the country's history. Explore the Maboneng Precinct and Newtown for its street art, and don't miss the Cradle of Humankind, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n2. **Kruger National Park** (Days 4-7): Enjoy a few days of safari tours. Early morning and late afternoon drives are the best times to see the animals. Consider a guided bush walk for a more intense experience.\n\n3. **Cape Town** (Days 8-14): Visit Table Mountain, explore the beaches, and take a day trip to the Cape of Good Hope. Visit the historic Robben Island. Go shark cage diving in Gansbaai, just a couple of hours drive from the city. Also, consider a visit to the beautiful Winelands for a wine tasting tour.\n\nRemember to check the current COVID-19 guidelines and restrictions for South Africa before you travel, and ensure you have travel insurance to cover any unexpected incidents. \n\nLet me know if you'd like more details or adjustments!",

Let's add some more excitement to your trip:\n\n**Kruger National Park:**\n\n1. **Adrenaline Activities**: While Kruger National Park itself is more focused on safaris, its proximity to Swaziland allows for adventure activities like canopy tours and white-water rafting. I recommend the Malolotja Nature Reserve in Swaziland for a canopy tour. It's about a 3-hour drive from Kruger, but it offers stunning views of the Malolotja River and Gorge. \n\n**Cape Town:**\n\n1. **Paragliding**: Paragliding from Lion's Head is a popular activity in Cape Town. You can book a tandem flight with a professional pilot, so no experience is necessary. This activity is highly weather-dependent, so be sure to schedule it earlier in your stay to allow for rescheduling if needed.\n\n2. **Surfing**: Muizenberg Beach is a top spot for surfing in Cape Town, especially for beginners. If you're more experienced, Dungeons in Hout Bay is famous for its big wave surfing.\n\n**Cuisine:**\n\n1. **Johannesburg**: Visit the Neighbourgoods Market in Braamfontein on a Saturday to try a variety of local and international foods.\n\n2. **Kruger National Park**: Try traditional South African barbecue, known as braai, at your lodge or local restaurants.\n\n3. **Cape Town**: Visit the Old Biscuit Mill in Woodstock for its Saturday Neighbourgoods Market. Here, you can try delicacies like bunny chow and koeksisters. For more traditional cuisine, try Marco's African Place in Bo-Kaap.\n\nRemember, always check the travel advisories and health and safety regulations regarding COVID-19 and other potential risks in each location.
