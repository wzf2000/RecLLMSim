            "content": "I'm glad to hear that the itinerary aligns with your interests. Let's look into the accommodations, flights, day trips, and Hogmanay celebrations in more detail.\n\n### Accommodations at The Dunstane Houses:\n\nGiven that my abilities to check real-time availability and pricing are limited, I would recommend visiting The Dunstane Houses' official website or calling them directly to inquire about availability for your specific travel dates in December. You can also use hotel booking platforms like Booking.com, Expedia, or Hotels.com to check rates and availability. As a ballpark figure, you can expect rates to be in the range of £150-£250 per night, but this can fluctuate based on the room type and booking time.\n\n### Flights from Charlotte to Edinburgh:\n\nFor a detailed flight plan, please consider using flight comparison websites like Kayak, Skyscanner, or Google Flights, where you can input your travel dates, preferences for minimal layovers, and airlines to find the best options. Typically, the cost for a roundtrip flight from Charlotte to Edinburgh in December can range from $800 to $1,500, depending on the airline, booking class, and how far in advance you book.\n\n### Day Trips:\n\n**Scottish Borders**:\n- Guided tours are available and can offer in-depth historical context and ease of travel. Rabbie's and Timberbush Tours are reputable companies offering such trips.\n\n**St. Andrews**:\n- Guided tours to St. Andrews often include visits to other Fife coastal towns. Alternatively, you can travel independently by train or bus for a more flexible schedule.\n\nBoth options have their merits. Guided tours relieve you of transportation logistics and provide expert insights, while independent travel allows for a more personal and leisurely exploration.\n\n### Hogmanay Celebrations:\n\nBooking Hogmanay events in advance is highly recommended as they are incredibly popular and can sell out quickly. Key events include the Street Party, Concert in the Gardens, and the Torchlight Procession. Tickets can usually be purchased online through the official Edinburgh's Hogmanay website or authorized ticketing platforms.\n\nPlease remember to secure these bookings as soon as possible to avoid disappointment. Additionally, some events may have age restrictions or may not be suitable for all individuals, so please ensure the events align with your preferences.\n\nWould you like assistance with any other aspects of your trip, or is there anything specific you'd like me to look into further for you?",
