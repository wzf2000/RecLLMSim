Maybe a park or a place where they can play and interact? \n\nLastly, for the dining options, the restaurants sound nice but are they child-friendly?

Arrive in Xi'an, check into your hotel and rest.\n2. Visit the Ancient City Wall. Renting bikes or taking a golf cart ride could be a fun experience for the kids.\n3. Have lunch at a family-friendly local restaurant.\n4. Visit Qujiang Pool Park in the afternoon for some relaxation and fun paddle boating.\n5.

I'm glad the adjustments to the itinerary suit your family's needs.\n\nBest Time to Visit Xi'an in Summer:\nSummer in Xi'an can be quite hot, with temperatures often rising above 30°C (86°F). The hottest months are typically July and August. If you're looking to avoid the extreme heat, consider going in early June or late August when the temperatures might be slightly more moderate. Additionally, summer can bring occasional rain, so it's wise to pack light rain gear.\n\nHigh-Speed Train Tickets:\nIt's highly recommended to book high-speed train tickets in advance, especially when traveling with children, to ensure you get seats together and to avoid any potential sell-outs, which are common for high-speed trains in China. Tickets go on sale 30 days before the travel date, and you can book them online or through a travel agent. For a smoother experience, consider having your tickets delivered to your hotel in Shanghai.\n\nHotel Services:\nThe Somerset Aparthotel, like many hotels, may offer services like airport or train station pick-ups, but this can vary and may incur an additional charge. It's best to contact the hotel directly to inquire about their services and book any necessary transportation in advance. If the hotel doesn't provide a pick-up service or if you're looking for a more economical option, you can take a taxi or use public transportation, like the airport shuttle bus or the subway, to reach the hotel from Xi'an Railway Station.\n\nBefore finalizing your travel plans, it's also a good idea to check the latest health and safety guidelines both for Shanghai and Xi'an, as well as any travel advisories that may affect your journey.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.
