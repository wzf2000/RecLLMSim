With your preferences in mind, here are a few destinations that offer warm weather, outdoor activities, and a vibrant nightlife scene in December, along with simplified visa processes for U.S. passport holders:\n\n1. **Mexico** - Places like Cancun, Playa del Carmen, or Tulum. You can enjoy the beautiful beaches, Mayan ruins, and lively clubs. U.S. citizens can travel to Mexico without a visa for short visits.\n\n2. **Costa Rica** - Known for its rainforests, volcanoes, and beaches. Activities include zip-lining, surfing, and wildlife tours. Nightlife is particularly good in Tamarindo and Jaco. No visa is required for stays up to 90 days.\n\n3. **Thailand** - Specifically, Bangkok and the islands like Phuket and Koh Samui. Thailand has a rich culture, stunning beaches, and a famous party scene. U.S. citizens can enter Thailand without a visa for up to 30 days.\n\n4. **Dominican Republic** - Punta Cana is a hotspot for beach lovers and partiers. With no visa needed for stays under 30 days, it's an easy-access destination.\n\n5. **Colombia** - Cities like Medellin and Cartagena offer a mix of historical sites, outdoor adventures, and nightlife. U.S. travelers can enter Colombia without a visa for up to 90 days.\n\nConsidering your budget, let's tentatively pick Mexico, as it's close to New York and typically offers good value for money, which means you can enjoy a variety of experiences without going over your budget. You can find direct flights from New York to Cancun, which is a major hub for tourists looking for a mix of relaxation and partying.\n\nHere's a rough outline of what your two-week itinerary could look like:\n\n**Week 1:**\n- Day 1-3: Cancun. Explore beaches, enjoy the nightlife, and relax at your hotel.\n- Day 4-5: Take a trip to Isla Mujeres for snorkeling and visit Underwater Museum of Art.\n- Day 6-7: Head to Playa del Carmen for more beach time, shopping, and nightlife.\n\n**Week 2:**\n- Day 8-10: Travel to Tulum. Visit the Mayan ruins, cenotes, and engage in eco-tourism activities.\n- Day 11-12: Consider a day trip to Cozumel for some of the best scuba diving.\n- Day 13: Return to Cancun or Playa del Carmen for last-minute shopping or relaxation.\n- Day 14: Prepare for your departure back to New York.\n\nFor accommodation, you could split your stays between hotels and Airbnb for a local experience. Use local transport like buses and colectivos (shared minivans) to get around affordably, or rent a car if you're comfortable driving.\n\nDoes this sound like a plan you’d be interested in? If so, I can start looking into flights, accommodations, and specific activities for you. If not, we can adjust the destination or itinerary according to your feedback!",

            "content": "Great choice! Cancun and Tulum are indeed known for their vibrant party scenes and captivating historical sites. Let's get started on finding you some good flight deals and accommodations that fall within your budget.\n\n**Flights:** Given that your trip is in December, it's a good idea to book your flights sooner rather than later to get the best prices. A round-trip flight from New York to Cancun typically ranges from $200 to $500, depending on the airline and how far in advance you book. I'd recommend setting up flight alerts on platforms like Skyscanner or Kayak to track price changes.\n\n**Accommodations:** In both Cancun and Tulum, you'll find a wide range of accommodations to suit different budgets. Here's a mix for you to consider:\n\n1. **Cancun:** \n   - *Selina Cancun Laguna Hotel Zone* (from $30 per night for a private room) - a budget-friendly yet comfortable hotel located in the heart of the Hotel Zone, where many of the best clubs, bars, and beaches are located.\n   - *MayaFair Design Hotel* (from $60 per night) - a boutique hotel offering stylish rooms in the Hotel Zone.\n   \n2. **Tulum:**\n   - *Lucky Traveler Hostel All Inclusive* (from $30 per night for a private room) - a budget option that includes free meals and drinks.\n   - *Hotel Casa Santiago Tulum* (from $90 per night) - a mid-range hotel with a pool, close to Tulum town and a short drive from the beach.\n\nAs for local sports events, soccer is highly popular in Mexico and the atmosphere at the games is often electric. The Mexican soccer season runs from July to May, so you're likely to catch a game in December. The home team in Cancun is *Atlante F.C.*, which plays in the Ascenso MX league. You might be able to catch a home game at Estadio Andrés Quintana Roo. \n\nI recommend checking their schedule closer to your travel dates to see if there's a match you can attend. Alternatively, many bars and restaurants in Cancun broadcast the matches of the more popular teams in the Mexican league, which can also be a fun way to experience the local sports culture.\n\nIf you're interested in participating in sports, there are plenty of beach volleyball games that happen on the beaches of Cancun and Tulum. Some hotels or hostels may also organize games or tournaments for their guests.\n\nDoes this information help? If you're happy with these options, I'd recommend starting to book your flights and accommodations as soon as possible to secure the best prices. Let me know if there's anything else you need assistance with!",
