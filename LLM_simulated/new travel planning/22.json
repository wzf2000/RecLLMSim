Barcelona is a fantastic choice and offers plenty to do.\n\n**Visa Requirements:**\nAs a U.S. citizen, you do not need a visa for tourist or business stays of up to 90 days in Spain (or any other member countries in the Schengen area). Just ensure your passport is valid for at least three months beyond your planned date of departure.\n\n**Flight Options:**\nThere are several airlines that operate flights from New York to Barcelona. Airlines such as Delta, American Airlines, and Iberia have direct flights. The flight duration is approximately 7-8 hours for a direct flight. Prices can vary greatly depending on when you book, but you can expect to pay in the region of $500-$1000 for a round trip in economy class. To get the best deal, I would recommend booking your flight at least 2-3 months in advance.\n\n**Weather:**\nIn December, Barcelona experiences mild winter weather. The average high temperature is around 15°C (59°F), and the average low is about 8°C (46°F). It's a relatively dry month with occasional rain. The city will be decorated for Christmas, adding a festive vibe.\n\nI can help you plan the details of your stay in Barcelona next, such as accommodations, attractions, and a potential day-by-day itinerary.
