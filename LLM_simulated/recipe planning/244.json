Italian cuisine is known for its delicious flavors and relatively simple recipes, making it a great option for someone with limited cooking experience. \n\nFor the main course, I recommend making a classic spaghetti with meatballs. It's a satisfying and flavorful dish that's relatively easy to prepare. As for the side dish, a fresh Caprese salad would complement the pasta nicely. And for dessert, let's go with a classic tiramisu, which is a creamy and decadent Italian dessert.\n\nNow that we have an idea of the dishes, let's move on to the ingredients. Here's what you'll need:\n\nSpaghetti with Meatballs:\n- Spaghetti noodles\n- Ground beef or a mix of ground beef and pork\n- Breadcrumbs\n- Parmesan cheese\n- Eggs\n- Onion\n- Garlic\n- Tomato sauce\n- Fresh basil (optional)\n- Salt and pepper\n- Olive oil\n\nCaprese Salad:\n- Fresh tomatoes\n- Fresh mozzarella cheese\n- Fresh basil leaves\n- Balsamic vinegar\n- Extra-virgin olive oil\n- Salt and pepper\n\nTiramisu:\n- Ladyfingers (sponge fingers)\n- Mascarpone cheese\n- Eggs\n- Sugar\n- Coffee (brewed and cooled)\n- Cocoa powder\n\nThese are the basic ingredients for each dish. Let me know if you need any substitutions or have any questions about the ingredients.",

Varieties like Roma tomatoes, vine-ripened tomatoes, or heirloom tomatoes work well. Look for tomatoes that are firm but slightly soft to the touch, with a vibrant red color.\n\nAs for the mozzarella cheese, fresh mozzarella is the traditional choice for Caprese salad. It's soft, creamy, and has a mild flavor that pairs perfectly with the tomatoes and basil. You can usually find fresh mozzarella in the refrigerated section of your grocery store, often packaged in water or brine. If you can't find fresh mozzarella, you can use regular mozzarella, but try to get the kind that comes in a block rather than pre-shredded, as it will have a better texture for slicing.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Happy cooking!",
            "content_zh": "不客气！我很高兴你喜欢意大利餐的想法。对于卡普雷塞沙拉，最好使用成熟而味道鲜美的番茄。像罗马番茄、藤熟番茄或古老品种番茄都很合适。寻找那些手感稍软但挺拔，颜色鲜艳的番茄。\n至于马苏里拉奶酪，新鲜的马苏里拉是卡普雷塞沙拉的传统选择。它柔软、奶香浓郁，与番茄和罗勒完美搭配。你通常可以在杂货店的冷藏柜中找到新鲜的马苏里拉，通常是包装在水中或盐水中。如果找不到新鲜的马苏里拉，可以使用普通马苏里拉，但尽量选择整块的，而不是预先切碎的，因为它的质地更适合切片。\n如果您有更多问题或需要进一步帮助，请随时提问。祝您烹饪愉快！",
