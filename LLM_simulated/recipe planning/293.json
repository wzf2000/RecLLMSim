Let's dive into creating your menu with these three courses.\n\nFor the Mediterranean-inspired appetizer, how about making bruschetta with a twist? Instead of the traditional tomato and basil, we can use roasted red peppers, feta cheese, and a drizzle of balsamic glaze. It's a refreshing and vibrant start to the meal.\n\nMoving on to the main course, let's infuse it with Asian flavors. How about preparing a delicious honey sesame glazed salmon? Marinate the salmon fillets in a mixture of soy sauce, honey, sesame oil, garlic, and ginger. Then, pan-sear or bake the salmon until it's perfectly cooked. Serve it with steamed jasmine rice and some stir-fried vegetables like bok choy or snap peas.\n\nNow, for the grand finale, let's add a French twist to a classic dessert. How about making a decadent chocolate lava cake? This dessert is sure to impress! Bake individual chocolate cakes with a gooey chocolate center, and serve them warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. It's the perfect way to end the meal on a sweet note.\n\nThese three courses should create a delightful fusion of flavors and cuisines.
