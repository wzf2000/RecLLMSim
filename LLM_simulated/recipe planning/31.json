Tear the romaine lettuce and toss it with the Caesar dressing. Top it with grated Parmesan cheese and croutons. Keep it refrigerated until serving.\n\n4. Once the chicken has marinated, preheat the grill and start grilling the chicken breasts. Make sure to cook them thoroughly until they reach an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C). Keep them warm under foil until you're ready to serve.\n\n5. While the chicken is grilling, prepare the grilled vegetables. Slice the vegetables, toss them with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and grill them until tender and slightly charred. You can keep them warm on a platter covered with foil.\n\n6. Lastly, prepare the grilled pineapple dessert. Sprinkle the pineapple slices with brown sugar and cinnamon, then grill them until caramelized. Serve them warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream if desired.\n\nBy following this order, you can ensure that everything is cooked and prepared in a timely manner.
