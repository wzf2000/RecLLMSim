Rinse the chicken thoroughly under cold water and pat it dry with paper towels.\n\n3. Place the chicken on a roasting pan or a baking dish with a rack to elevate it.\n\n4. Cut one lemon in half and squeeze the juice over the chicken, making sure to coat it well.\n\n5. Take the other lemon and cut it into slices. Set aside a few slices for garnish, and then stuff the remaining slices into the cavity of the chicken.\n\n6. Finely chop your fresh herbs (rosemary, thyme, and oregano). You'll need about 2 tablespoons of each. If you don't have fresh herbs, dried herbs will work too, but reduce the quantity to 1 tablespoon each.\n\n7. In a small bowl, combine the chopped herbs, minced garlic, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, salt, and pepper. Mix well to form a paste.\n\n8. Rub the herb paste all over the chicken, making sure to coat it evenly. You can use your hands or a basting brush.\n\n9. Place the chicken in the preheated oven and roast for about 1 hour and 15 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Baste the chicken with the pan juices every 30 minutes for added flavor and moisture.\n\n10. Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes before carving. This allows the juices to redistribute and ensures a juicy and tender chicken.\n\n11. Garnish with the reserved lemon slices and some fresh herbs for presentation.\n\nThat's it! Your Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken is ready to be enjoyed. While the chicken is resting, we can move on to preparing the Greek Salad and Roasted Vegetables. Let me know when you're ready to proceed or if you have any questions along the way!",

In a large bowl, combine the sliced red onion, diced cucumbers, tomatoes, Kalamata olives, and crumbled feta cheese.\n\n3. In a small bowl, whisk together 3 tablespoons of olive oil, 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar, salt, and pepper to make the dressing.\n\n4.

It's a refreshing and tangy side dish that pairs perfectly with the Mediterranean flavors of the roasted chicken.\n\nRoasted Vegetables:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).\n\n2. Wash and chop your assorted vegetables into similar-sized pieces. For example, you can slice bell peppers into strips, cube zucchini and eggplant, and keep cherry tomatoes whole.\n\n3. In a large mixing bowl, toss the chopped vegetables with 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil, dried herbs (such as oregano and thyme), salt, and pepper. Make sure the vegetables are evenly coated with the oil and seasoning.\n\n4. Spread the vegetables in a single layer on a baking sheet.\n\n5. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and roast for about 20-25 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and slightly caramelized.\n\n6. Once roasted, remove the vegetables from the oven and transfer them to a serving dish.\n\nYour Roasted Vegetables are now ready to be enjoyed alongside the Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken and Greek Salad.\n\nI hope you find the instructions clear and easy to follow.
