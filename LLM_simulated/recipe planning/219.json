We can pair it with some flavorful sides to make it a complete and hearty meal. Here's a recipe and some ideas for you:\n\nGrilled Lemon Herb Chicken with Roasted Potatoes and Grilled Vegetables\n\nIngredients:\n- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n- 2 lemons\n- Fresh herbs (such as rosemary, thyme, or parsley)\n- Olive oil\n- Salt and pepper\n- 4-6 medium-sized potatoes\n- Assorted vegetables for grilling (such as bell peppers, zucchini, and eggplant)\n\nInstructions:\n1. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.\n2. Squeeze the juice of one lemon into a bowl and add some olive oil, salt, pepper, and your choice of fresh herbs. Mix well.\n3. Place the chicken breasts in the marinade and let them sit for about 15-20 minutes while you prepare the other ingredients.\n4. Cut the potatoes into bite-sized pieces and toss them with olive oil, salt, pepper, and any herbs you like. Spread them on a baking sheet and roast them in the oven at 400°F (200°C) until they are golden and crispy (usually takes around 30-40 minutes).\n5. While the potatoes are roasting, prepare the vegetables for grilling. Slice them into thick pieces and brush them with olive oil, salt, and pepper.\n6. Grill the chicken breasts for about 6-8 minutes per side until they are cooked through and have nice grill marks. Squeeze some fresh lemon juice over the chicken while grilling.\n7. At the same time, grill the vegetables until they are tender and have some char marks.\n8. Once everything is cooked, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing it.\n9. Serve the grilled chicken with roasted potatoes and grilled vegetables on the side. Squeeze some more lemon juice over the chicken and garnish with fresh herbs if desired.\n\nThis recipe should provide you with a hearty and flavorful meal. Feel free to adjust the seasonings and ingredients to your taste. Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!",

Bell peppers, zucchini, and eggplant are great choices for grilling. They hold up well on the grill and develop a delicious smoky flavor. You can also consider grilling some asparagus, mushrooms, or red onions for variety. These vegetables complement the chicken nicely and provide a colorful and nutritious side dish.\n\nRemember to brush the vegetables with olive oil, salt, and pepper before grilling to enhance their flavors.
