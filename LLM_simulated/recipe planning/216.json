            "content": "I'm glad you like the plan! Here are some answers to your questions:\n\n1. For the sushi rice preparation, you're right! Sushi rice is typically seasoned with vinegar, sugar, and salt. To prepare it, you'll need sushi rice (also known as short-grain Japanese rice), which you can find at most grocery stores. Cook the rice according to the package instructions, and once it's done, transfer it to a large bowl. In a separate small bowl, mix together rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Gently fold this vinegar mixture into the cooked rice while it's still warm. Be careful not to mash the rice; instead, use a cutting and folding motion to evenly distribute the seasoning. Allow the rice to cool to room temperature before using it for the sushi rolls.\n\n2. When it comes to vegetables for sushi rolls, you have plenty of options! Some popular choices include cucumber, carrot, bell pepper, avocado, and even lightly blanched asparagus. These vegetables provide a nice crunch and add freshness to the rolls. Feel free to mix and match based on your preferences. You can also add some cooked shrimp or imitation crab if you'd like to incorporate seafood.\n\nRemember, you can get creative and add any other ingredients you enjoy, like sesame seeds, spicy mayo, or even a drizzle of teriyaki sauce for added flavor. Have fun experimenting and customizing your sushi rolls!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Happy cooking, and I hope your meal turns out delicious!",
            "content_zh": "我很高兴你喜欢这个计划！以下是一些建答案解答你的问题：\n\n1. 对于寿司米的准备，你说得对！寿司米通常用醋、糖和盐调味。要准备它，你需要寿司米（也称为日本短粒米），你可以在大多数杂货店购买到。根据包装说明煮熟米饭，煮熟后将其转移到一个大碗中。在一个小碗中，将米醋、糖和盐混合在一起。在米煮熟时，把这个醋混合物轻轻地拌入米饭中。小心不要把米捣烂；取而代之的是，用切割和折叠的动作均匀地分配调味料。让米饭冷却至室温后再用于寿司卷。\n\n2. 当谈到寿司卷的蔬菜时，你有很多选择！一些受欢迎的选择包括黄瓜、胡萝卜、甜椒、鳄梨，甚至稍微焯烫过的芦笋。这些蔬菜提供了不错的嚼劲并为寿司卷增添了新鲜感。根据你的喜好，随意搭配。如果想要加入海鲜，你也可以添加一些煮熟的虾或仿蟹肉。\n\n记住，你可以发挥创造力，添加你喜欢的任何其他配料，比如芝麻、辣美乃滋，甚至加一点照烧酱增添风味。尽情尝试并自定义你的寿司卷！\n\n如果你有更多问题或需要进一步帮助，请随时提问。祝你烹饪愉快，希望你的餐点美味！",
