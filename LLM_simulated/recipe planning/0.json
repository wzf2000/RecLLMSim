This way, you'll have a well-rounded meal that caters to everyone's tastes.\n\nFor the protein-rich main dish, a classic option could be a roast chicken. It's relatively simple to prepare and always a crowd-pleaser. You'll need a whole chicken, olive oil, salt, pepper, and any additional herbs or spices you enjoy.\n\nFor the vegetarian dish, how about a flavorful vegetable stir-fry? You can use a variety of colorful vegetables like bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, and snap peas. Add some garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and a touch of honey or maple syrup for a delicious sauce.\n\nAs for the sides, you could make a quinoa salad with roasted vegetables and feta cheese. Roast some cherry tomatoes, zucchini, and red onions in the oven with olive oil, salt, and pepper, then mix them with cooked quinoa and crumbled feta cheese. It's a nutritious and tasty option.\n\nAnother side dish idea is garlic roasted potatoes. Cut some potatoes into small cubes, toss them with olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper, then roast them in the oven until crispy and golden brown.\n\nFor dessert, something simple yet satisfying could be a fruit salad with a drizzle of honey and a sprinkle of mint leaves.\n\nHow does this menu sound to you? Let me know if you have any preferences or if there's anything else you'd like to include!",
