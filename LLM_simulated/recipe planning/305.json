Hummus and Pita Bread: Serve the quinoa salad with some freshly made hummus and warm pita bread. It adds a creamy and protein-rich element to the meal.\n\n3. Greek Yogurt Sauce: Whip up a quick Greek yogurt sauce by combining yogurt, minced garlic, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt. It makes a refreshing and tangy addition to the quinoa salad.\n\nAs for other recipe ideas, how about trying a hearty vegetable stir-fry with tofu or a flavorful chickpea curry?
