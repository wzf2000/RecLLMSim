            "content": "Certainly! Here's a breakdown of the preparation process for each dish, along with the suggested order of preparation:\n\n1. Meat Option: Prime Rib or Roasted Chicken\n   - Prime Rib:\n     - Preheat the oven and season the prime rib with salt, pepper, and your choice of herbs and spices.\n     - Roast the prime rib in the oven at a high temperature initially, then lower the temperature for even cooking.\n     - Use a meat thermometer to ensure it reaches your desired level of doneness.\n   - Roasted Chicken:\n     - Preheat the oven and season the chicken with salt, pepper, and your choice of herbs and spices.\n     - Roast the chicken in the oven until it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).\n     - Let it rest before carving to ensure juiciness.\n\n2. Vegetarian Option: Stuffed Butternut Squash or Mushroom Wellington\n   - Stuffed Butternut Squash:\n     - Cut the butternut squash in half lengthwise, scoop out the seeds, and roast it until tender.\n     - Prepare a flavorful stuffing with ingredients like quinoa, vegetables, herbs, and cheese.\n     - Fill the roasted butternut squash halves with the stuffing and bake until golden and heated through.\n   - Mushroom Wellington:\n     - Sauté a mixture of mushrooms, onions, garlic, and herbs until cooked and fragrant.\n     - Roll out puff pastry and spread the mushroom mixture over it.\n     - Wrap the puff pastry tightly around the mushroom filling, sealing the edges, and bake until golden and crisp.\n\n3. Classic Sides:\n   - Creamy Mashed Potatoes:\n     - Boil peeled and diced potatoes until tender, then drain.\n     - Mash the potatoes with butter, cream/milk, salt, and pepper until smooth and creamy.\n   - Roasted Vegetables:\n     - Toss a variety of vegetables (such as carrots, Brussels sprouts, and potatoes) with olive oil, salt, pepper, and herbs.\n     - Roast in the oven until golden and caramelized.\n   - Fresh Green Salad:\n     - Wash and dry your choice of salad greens.\n     - Toss them with a vinaigrette made from olive oil, vinegar/lemon juice, mustard, salt, and pepper.\n\n4. Dessert: Birthday Cake or Chocolate Mousse\n   - Birthday Cake:\n     - Choose your favorite cake recipe or mix and bake it in layers.\n     - Let the cake cool, then frost it with your preferred frosting and decorate as desired.\n   - Chocolate Mousse:\n     - Melt chocolate and let it cool slightly.\n     - Whip heavy cream until soft peaks form, then fold in the melted chocolate.\n     - Chill the mousse in the refrigerator until set.\n\nIn terms of order, here's a suggested timeline:\n1. Start with the dessert preparations, as both the cake and mousse can be made ahead of time and chilled.\n2. Move on to the main courses, as they usually require longer cooking times.\n3. While the main courses are cooking, prepare the sides, starting with the mashed potatoes (which can be kept warm).\n4. As the sides are cooking, work on the vegetarian option, whether it's the stuffed butternut squash or mushroom Wellington.\n5. Lastly, assemble the fresh green salad just before serving.\n\nRemember to allocate enough time for resting, carving, and plating the meat option. With proper planning and organization, everything should be ready to serve at the desired time. Enjoy your birthday celebration! Let me know if you need any further assistance.",
