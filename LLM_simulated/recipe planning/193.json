It's a delicious and healthy meal that's relatively easy to prepare. Here's a simple recipe to follow:\n\nIngredients:\n- 2 salmon fillets (about 6 ounces each)\n- 1 lemon\n- 2 tablespoons of olive oil\n- 2 cloves of garlic, minced\n- 1 teaspoon of dried herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, or dill)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Assorted vegetables for roasting (e.g., broccoli, carrots, bell peppers, zucchini)\n\nInstructions:\n1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).\n2. Prepare the vegetables by washing and cutting them into bite-sized pieces.\n3. Place the vegetables on a baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat evenly.\n4. In a small bowl, combine the minced garlic, dried herbs, the juice of half a lemon, and olive oil. Mix well.\n5. Place the salmon fillets on a separate baking sheet lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Season the salmon with salt and pepper.\n6. Pour the lemon herb mixture over the salmon fillets, making sure they are evenly coated.\n7. Slice the remaining half of the lemon into thin rounds and place them on top of the salmon fillets.\n8. Place both baking sheets in the preheated oven. Roast the vegetables for about 20-25 minutes or until they are tender and slightly caramelized. Bake the salmon for about 12-15 minutes or until it flakes easily with a fork.\n9. Once cooked, remove the salmon and vegetables from the oven.\n10. Serve the salmon with a side of roasted vegetables and garnish with fresh herbs or a squeeze of lemon juice if desired.\n\nThis recipe should give you a delicious and nutritious meal. Feel free to adjust the cooking times based on the thickness of the salmon fillets and your desired level of doneness. Enjoy your homemade protein-rich dish!",
