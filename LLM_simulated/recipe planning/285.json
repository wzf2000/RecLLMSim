Cook the noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.\n2. Heat the oil in a large pan or wok over medium-high heat.\n3. Add the minced garlic and sliced onion to the pan. Stir-fry for a minute until fragrant and slightly softened.\n4. Add the protein to the pan and cook until it's browned and cooked through. If you're using shrimp, they should turn pink.\n5.

Drizzle the soy sauce and oyster sauce (if using) over the noodles and vegetables. Stir-fry for another minute to coat everything evenly.\n8. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed.\n9.
