Here's an idea for a three-course meal that combines both:\n\nAppetizer:\n- Sushi Rolls: You can make a variety of sushi rolls using fresh ingredients like avocado, cucumber, carrots, and your choice of fish or vegetarian options. Some popular choices include California rolls, spicy tuna rolls, or vegetable rolls. Serve them with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger.\n\nMain Course:\n- Grilled Salmon Salad: Marinate salmon fillets in a mixture of soy sauce, honey, garlic, and ginger. Grill the salmon until it's cooked to your liking. For the salad, combine mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, sliced cucumbers, and thinly sliced red onions. Toss the salad with a light dressing made from olive oil, lemon juice, and a touch of honey. Place the grilled salmon on top of the salad for a healthy and flavorful main course.\n\nDessert:\n- Fruit Sushi: For a fun twist, you can make fruit sushi for dessert. Use sweet sushi rice as the base and roll it with thinly sliced fruits like mango, strawberries, and kiwi. You can even drizzle some honey or a citrus glaze on top. It's a refreshing and light way to end the meal.\n\nTo set the cozy and intimate ambiance, dim the lights and place some candles on the table. Soft instrumental music or your favorite romantic tunes playing in the background will add to the atmosphere. Don't forget to decorate the table with some fresh flowers or a small centerpiece to complete the look.\n\nI hope this helps you create a memorable dining experience for you and your loved one! Let me know if you need any further assistance or if you have any other preferences.",
            "content_zh": "听起来是一个可爱的计划！我们可以在菜单中加入寿司和沙拉，并保持健康意识。以下是一个结合了两者的三道菜的想法：\n\n头盘：\n- 寿司卷：您可以使用新鲜的配料制作各种寿司卷，如鳄梨、黄瓜、胡萝卜以及您喜欢的鱼类或素食选项。一些受欢迎的选择包括加州卷、辣味金枪鱼卷或素食卷。搭配酱油、芥末和泡姜一起享用。\n\n主菜：\n- 烤三文鱼沙拉：用酱油、蜜糖、大蒜和小姜混合液腌制三文鱼片。将三文鱼烤至您喜欢的程度。将混合绿叶、樱桃番茄、黄瓜片和切成薄片的红洋葱混合成沙拉。用橄榄油、柠檬汁和少许蜜糖调制轻盈的调味品。将烤好的三文鱼放在沙拉顶部，作为富有营养和美味的主菜。\n\n甜点：\n- 水果寿司：为了一个有趣的变化，您可以做水果寿司作为甜点。使用甜寿司米作为基础，加入薄切的芒果、草莓和猕猴桃等水果卷成寿司。甚至可以在顶部淋上一些蜂蜜或柑橘酱。这是一个清爽而轻盈的结束餐点方式。\n\n为了营造温馨和亲密的氛围，调暗灯光并在桌上放上一些蜡烛。轻柔的器乐音乐或您喜爱的浪漫曲目作为背景音乐将增添氛围。不要忘记用一些鲜花或小中心装饰桌子，来完成整体外观。\n\n希望这能帮助您为您和您爱的人创造一个难忘的用餐体验！如果您需要进一步帮助或有其他偏好，请告诉我。",
