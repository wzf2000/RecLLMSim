Let's break down the recipe into three parts: the steak, the roasted potatoes, and the sautéed vegetables. \n\nFor the steak, you'll need the following ingredients:\n- Steak (choose your preferred cut, such as ribeye, sirloin, or filet mignon)\n- Salt and pepper (to season)\n- Olive oil (for grilling)\n\nFor the roasted potatoes, you'll need:\n- Potatoes (choose your favorite variety, like russet or Yukon gold)\n- Olive oil\n- Salt and pepper\n- Optional herbs and spices (such as rosemary, thyme, or paprika)\n\nFor the sautéed vegetables, you can choose your favorites, but here are some suggestions:\n- Bell peppers (red, green, or yellow)\n- Zucchini\n- Mushrooms\n- Onion\n- Garlic\n- Olive oil\n- Salt and pepper\n\nNow, let's move on to the cooking process. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.\n2. Season the steak generously with salt and pepper on both sides.\n3. Drizzle a bit of olive oil on the steak and rub it in to coat evenly.\n4. Place the steak on the preheated grill and cook for about 4-6 minutes per side, depending on your desired level of doneness.\n5. While the steak is cooking, preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) for the roasted potatoes.\n6. Wash and cut the potatoes into bite-sized pieces. Toss them in a bowl with olive oil, salt, pepper, and any optional herbs or spices.\n7. Spread the potatoes evenly on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until they turn golden brown and crispy.\n8. While the potatoes are roasting, prepare the sautéed vegetables. Wash and chop the vegetables into your desired size.\n9. Heat some olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic, sautéing until they become translucent and fragrant.\n10. Add the remaining vegetables to the pan and cook until they are tender-crisp, usually around 5-7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\nOnce everything is cooked, you can plate your meal by placing the grilled steak alongside the roasted potatoes and sautéed vegetables. You can also add a sauce or condiment of your choice, such as a chimichurri sauce or a simple pan sauce made from the steak drippings.\n\nI hope this recipe and guide help you create a delicious and hearty meal! Let me know if you have any further questions or need more assistance along the way. Enjoy your cooking!",
