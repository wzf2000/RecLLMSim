Vegetable Crudité with Vegan Ranch Dip:\n   - Wash and prepare a variety of seasonal vegetables like carrots, cucumbers, radishes, and cherry tomatoes.\n   - Slice the vegetables into bite-sized pieces and arrange them on a platter.\n   - For the vegan ranch dip, combine vegan mayo, non-dairy milk (such as almond or soy milk), dried dill, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Adjust the seasonings to taste. Chill the dip before serving.\n\n2. Roasted Beet and Citrus Salad:\n   - Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).\n   - Scrub and trim the beets, then wrap them individually in foil. Place them on a baking sheet and roast for about 45-60 minutes, or until tender.\n   - Once the beets are cool enough to handle, peel and dice them into bite-sized pieces.\n   - Peel and segment citrus fruits like oranges and grapefruits, removing any pith and seeds.\n   - In a bowl, combine the roasted beets, citrus segments, baby greens, and a simple dressing made with olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Toss gently to coat.\n\n3. Stuffed Bell Peppers with Quinoa and Black Beans:\n   - Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).\n   - Cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds and membranes.\n   - Cook quinoa according to package instructions.\n   - In a skillet, sauté diced onions, minced garlic, and chopped bell pepper scraps until softened. Add cooked quinoa, black beans, spices (such as cumin, paprika, and chili powder), salt, and pepper. Cook for a few minutes until well combined.\n   - Stuff the bell peppers with the quinoa and black bean mixture. Place them in a baking dish and bake for about 25-30 minutes, or until the peppers are tender.\n\n4. Roasted Seasonal Vegetables:\n   - Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).\n   - Wash, peel (if necessary), and chop a variety of seasonal vegetables into bite-sized pieces.\n   - Toss the vegetables with olive oil, salt, pepper, and any desired herbs or spices.\n   - Spread the vegetables in a single layer on a baking sheet and roast for about 20-30 minutes, or until they are nicely browned and tender.\n\n5.

Blend until smooth.\n   - Transfer the mixture to a bowl and add chia seeds. Stir well to combine.\n   - Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight, allowing the chia seeds to absorb the liquid and thicken the pudding.\n   - Serve the chia pudding chilled, topped with fresh mango slices or other desired toppings.\n\nIn terms of the order of preparation, here's a suggested timeline:\n1. Start by preparing the vegan ranch dip and refrigerate it.\n2. Move on to roasting the beets for the salad while you prepare the other ingredients for the salad.\n3. Once the beets are roasted and cooled, dice them and assemble the beet and citrus salad.\n4. Prepare the stuffed bell peppers and place them in the oven to bake.\n5. While the bell peppers are baking, prepare the focaccia dough and let it rise.\n6. Once the bell peppers are done, remove them from the oven and keep them warm.\n7. Shape and bake the focaccia.\n8.
