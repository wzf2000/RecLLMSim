For the bruschetta, make sure to use ripe and flavorful tomatoes for the best results. You can also drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil on top just before serving to enhance the flavors.\n\n2. When grilling the Mediterranean chicken, preheat the grill to medium-high heat and oil the grates to prevent sticking. Keep an eye on the chicken to avoid overcooking and dryness. If you don't have a grill, you can also use a grill pan or bake the chicken in the oven.\n\n3. For the lemon herb couscous, fluff the cooked couscous with a fork to prevent clumping. Adding a squeeze of fresh lemon juice just before serving will enhance the citrus flavor.\n\n4. When making the lemon ricotta cake, be sure to beat the ricotta cheese until smooth before incorporating it into the batter. This will help create a lighter texture. Also, make sure to zest the lemons before juicing them, as the zest provides intense lemon flavor.\n\n5. To make the raspberry sauce for the cake, you can strain the puree through a fine-mesh sieve if you prefer a smoother texture. Adjust the sweetness of the sauce by adding sugar gradually, tasting as you go.\n\nRemember to enjoy the process and have fun while cooking! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Good luck, and I hope you and your loved one have a wonderful meal together!",
            "content_zh": "非常欢迎！我很高兴你喜欢这份菜单，我相信你会做出美味的菜肴。以下是一些建议，帮助你在制作过程中顺利进行：\n1. 烤面包片时，请确保选用熟透和风味浓郁的番茄以获得最佳效果。你也可以在上菜前滴上一点特级初榨橄榄油来增强风味。\n2. 烤地中海鸡肉时，预热烤炉至中高温，并在烤架上抹油以避免粘连。留意鸡肉，避免过度烹饪和变干。如果没有烤炉，也可以使用烤盘或在烤箱中烘烤鸡肉。\n3. 制作柠檬香草小麦米时，用叉子拌松已煮熟的小麦米以避免串团。上菜前滴入一些新鲜柠檬汁可以增强柑橙风味。\n4. 制作柠檬乳酪蛋糕时，请确保将乳酪搅打至顺滑后再加入蛋糊中。这将有助于制造出更轻盈的质地。另外，请在榨汁之前将柠檬刨皮，因为皮提供了强烈的柠檬风味。\n5. 制作蛋糕用的覆盆子酱时，如果你希望更顺滑的口感，可以通过细网筛过浆。通过逐渐加糖并边尝试边品尝来调整酱汁的甜度。\n记得享受制作的过程，并在烹饪过程中玩得开心！如果有更多问题或需要进一步帮助，请随时问。祝你好运，希望你和你的爱人能一起享用美好的晚餐！",
