We can use a variety of toppings like fresh tomatoes, basil, mozzarella, and maybe even some balsamic glaze for an added touch.\n\nFor the main course, let's consider a flavorful and aromatic dish like a Moroccan-inspired roasted chicken with couscous. We can marinate the chicken with a blend of spices such as cumin, coriander, paprika, and cinnamon. Then, roast it to perfection and serve it alongside fluffy couscous and a side of roasted vegetables.\n\nTo complement the meal, we can prepare a vibrant and refreshing salad. How about a mixed greens salad with fresh strawberries, goat cheese, candied pecans, and a tangy balsamic vinaigrette? This combination of flavors will provide a nice balance to the main course.\n\nLastly, let's not forget about dessert! Since it's a birthday celebration, a decadent chocolate cake with a rich ganache frosting could be a showstopper. We can also add some fresh berries on the side for a pop of color and freshness.\n\nWhat do you think of these ideas? Feel free to provide any feedback or suggest any changes.",
