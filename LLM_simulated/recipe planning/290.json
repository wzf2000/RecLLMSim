How about we start with a few appetizer options to kick off the meal? Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. Mediterranean Mezze Platter: Include a selection of hummus, tzatziki, marinated olives, stuffed grape leaves, roasted red peppers, and pita bread.\n\n2. Vietnamese Fresh Spring Rolls: These refreshing rolls can be filled with shrimp, vermicelli noodles, fresh herbs like mint and cilantro, and served with a peanut dipping sauce.\n\n3. Caprese Skewers: Skewer cherry tomatoes, mozzarella balls, and fresh basil leaves. Drizzle with balsamic glaze for a simple yet delicious appetizer.\n\nFor the main course, we can go for a combination of dishes to cater to different preferences. Here are a few options:\n\n1. Herb-Roasted Chicken: Marinate chicken with a blend of herbs like rosemary, thyme, and garlic. Roast until golden and serve with a side of roasted vegetables.\n\n2. Vegetarian Stuffed Bell Peppers: Fill bell peppers with a mixture of quinoa, black beans, corn, and spices. Top with cheese and bake until tender.\n\n3. Pan-Seared Salmon with Lemon Butter Sauce: Sear salmon fillets until crispy on the outside and serve with a tangy lemon butter sauce. Pair it with a side of roasted asparagus or a fresh salad.\n\nTo accompany the main dishes, we can add a couple of side dishes such as roasted potatoes, a mixed green salad, or a flavorful grain pilaf.\n\nAnd finally, for dessert, we can't go wrong with a classic birthday cake! You can choose your favorite flavor, whether it's chocolate, vanilla, or something more unique. Decorate it with frosting, candles, and any additional toppings you desire.\n\nI hope these suggestions provide a good starting point for your birthday meal planning. Let me know if you have any specific preferences or if there's anything else I can assist you with!",
