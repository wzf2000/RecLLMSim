In a bowl, combine the diced tomatoes, minced garlic, chopped basil, a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper. Mix well.\n5.

Arrange half of the soaked ladyfingers in a single layer in a serving dish or individual glasses.\n4. In a mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar until creamy and pale yellow.\n5. Add the mascarpone cheese to the egg yolk mixture and beat until well combined and smooth.\n6. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form.\n7. In another clean bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.\n8. Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture, followed by the beaten egg whites.\n9.
