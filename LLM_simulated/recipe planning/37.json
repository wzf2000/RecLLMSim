Here's an idea for a three-course meal that incorporates different flavors and textures:\n\nAppetizer: Thai-inspired Shrimp Lettuce Wraps\n- Ingredients: Shrimp, lettuce leaves, carrots, cucumbers, fresh herbs (such as cilantro and mint), lime juice, soy sauce, honey, garlic, ginger, peanuts (optional).\n- Instructions: Marinate the shrimp in a mixture of soy sauce, honey, garlic, and ginger. Sauté the shrimp until cooked, then assemble the wraps by placing the cooked shrimp, julienned carrots, cucumbers, and fresh herbs on lettuce leaves. Drizzle with lime juice and sprinkle with crushed peanuts for added crunch.\n\nMain Course: Mediterranean-inspired Baked Salmon with Lemon-Dill Sauce\n- Ingredients: Salmon fillets, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, fresh dill, salt, pepper.\n- Instructions: Preheat the oven and prepare a baking dish. Place the salmon fillets in the dish and season with salt, pepper, minced garlic, and a drizzle of olive oil. Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the fillets and sprinkle with chopped dill. Bake in the oven until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily.\n\nDessert: Tropical Fruit Parfait\n- Ingredients: Fresh tropical fruits (such as mango, pineapple, and kiwi), Greek yogurt, honey, granola.\n- Instructions: Layer diced fruits, Greek yogurt, and a drizzle of honey in individual serving glasses. Repeat the layers, ending with a dollop of yogurt on top. Sprinkle granola over the yogurt for added texture. Chill in the refrigerator until ready to serve.\n\nThese dishes should provide a balance of flavors and showcase different cooking techniques. They are also relatively simple to prepare, allowing you to focus on enjoying the meal with your friends. Let me know if you'd like more details or if there's anything else I can assist you with!",
