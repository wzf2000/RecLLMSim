How about we design a menu that includes a variety of sushi rolls, a vibrant salad, and perhaps a light miso soup to start? Here's a suggested menu:\n\n1. Miso Soup:\n   - Ingredients: Miso paste, tofu, seaweed, green onions, dashi (optional)\n   - Instructions: Heat water and dissolve miso paste in it. Add tofu, seaweed, and dashi (if using). Simmer for a few minutes, then garnish with green onions.\n\n2. Sushi Rolls:\n   - California Roll:\n     - Ingredients: Nori (seaweed sheets), sushi rice, crab meat or imitation crab, avocado, cucumber, sesame seeds\n     - Instructions: Spread sushi rice on a sheet of nori, leaving a small border. Add crab, avocado, and cucumber in the center. Roll tightly, using a bamboo mat if available. Cut into bite-sized pieces and sprinkle sesame seeds on top.\n\n   - Spicy Tuna Roll:\n     - Ingredients: Nori, sushi rice, fresh tuna, mayonnaise, sriracha sauce, green onions\n     - Instructions: Mix diced fresh tuna with mayonnaise and sriracha sauce to create a spicy tuna mixture. Spread sushi rice on nori, add the spicy tuna mixture, and roll tightly. Cut into pieces and garnish with chopped green onions.\n\n3. Vibrant Salad:\n   - Ingredients: Mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, carrots, radishes, avocado, sesame seeds\n   - Dressing: Olive oil, lemon juice, soy sauce, honey (optional), sesame oil\n   - Instructions: Toss the mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, carrots, radishes, and avocado. In a separate bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, soy sauce, honey (if desired), and a drizzle of sesame oil. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and sprinkle sesame seeds on top.\n\nYou can adjust the quantities based on your preferences and the number of servings needed.
