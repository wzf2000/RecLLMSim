This dish will have the familiar flavors of Mediterranean herbs and spices, while the dipping sauce will add a zing of Asian flair. It's a perfect blend of two culinary traditions.\n\nFor the chicken skewers, we'll need:\n- Boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into cubes\n- Olive oil\n- Lemon juice\n- Garlic, minced\n- Dried oregano\n- Salt and pepper\n- Skewers (if using wooden skewers, remember to soak them in water for about 30 minutes to prevent burning)\n\nFor the Asian dipping sauce, we'll need:\n- Soy sauce\n- Rice vinegar\n- Honey or brown sugar\n- Fresh ginger, grated\n- Garlic, minced\n- Sesame oil\n- Red pepper flakes (optional, for some heat)\n- Chopped green onions or cilantro for garnish\n\nTo prepare the dish:\n1. In a bowl, mix olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Add the chicken cubes and marinate for at least 30 minutes, or longer if possible.\n2. While the chicken is marinating, prepare the Asian dipping sauce. In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey or brown sugar, grated ginger, minced garlic, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes (if using). Adjust the quantities to suit your taste preferences.\n3. Preheat your grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Thread the marinated chicken cubes onto skewers.\n4. Grill the chicken skewers for about 6-8 minutes, turning occasionally, until they are cooked through and have a nice char.\n5. Serve the grilled chicken skewers with the Asian dipping sauce on the side. Garnish with chopped green onions or cilantro for added freshness.\n\nThis fusion dish will offer a tantalizing combination of Mediterranean flavors and Asian tang.
