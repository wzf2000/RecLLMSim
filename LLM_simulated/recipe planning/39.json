Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Side Salad: A fresh and vibrant salad would pair nicely with the stuffed bell peppers. You can make a simple green salad with mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumber slices, and a light vinaigrette dressing.\n\n2. Roasted Vegetables: Roasting vegetables brings out their natural sweetness and adds a delicious depth of flavor. Consider roasting some vegetables like carrots, zucchini, and cauliflower tossed with olive oil, salt, and pepper.\n\n3. Garlic Bread: A warm and crusty garlic bread is always a crowd-pleaser. You can either make your own by toasting sliced baguette with garlic butter or pick up a pre-made garlic bread from the store.\n\n4. Quinoa or Rice Pilaf: Since you already have quinoa in the stuffed peppers, you can make an extra batch and serve it as a side dish. Alternatively, you can prepare a simple rice pilaf with aromatic spices like cumin, turmeric, and cardamom.\n\n5. Greek Yogurt Dip: For a refreshing dip, mix Greek yogurt with minced garlic, lemon juice, chopped cucumber, and dill. It's a cool and tangy accompaniment that complements the flavors of the stuffed peppers.\n\nFeel free to choose any of these sides or mix and match based on your preferences.
