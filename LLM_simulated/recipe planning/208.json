In a large bowl, combine cooked rice, black beans, corn, diced onion, minced garlic, cumin, paprika, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well.\n4. Stuff the bell peppers with the rice and bean mixture.\n5. Place the stuffed bell peppers in a baking dish and cover with foil.\n6. Bake for about 30-35 minutes or until the peppers are tender.\n7. Optional: Remove the foil, sprinkle shredded cheese on top of each pepper, and bake for an additional 5 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly.\n8. Serve the stuffed bell peppers hot with a side dish.\n\nSide Dish:\nRoasted Garlic Parmesan Potatoes\n\nIngredients:\n- 4-5 medium-sized potatoes, cut into wedges\n- 4 cloves garlic, minced\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n\nInstructions:\n1. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).\n2. In a large bowl, combine the potato wedges, minced garlic, olive oil, grated Parmesan cheese, dried rosemary, salt, and pepper. Toss until the potatoes are well coated.\n3. Spread the potato wedges evenly on a baking sheet.\n4. Roast in the oven for about 30-35 minutes or until the potatoes are golden brown and crispy.\n5. Remove from the oven and serve hot alongside the stuffed bell peppers.\n\nDessert:\nClassic Chocolate Chip Cookies\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened\n- 1 cup granulated sugar\n- 1 cup brown sugar, packed\n- 2 large eggs\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n- 3 cups all-purpose flour\n- 1 teaspoon baking soda\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n- 2 cups chocolate chips\n\nInstructions:\n1.

Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.\n4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing until just combined.\n5. Fold in the chocolate chips.\n6. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto a baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.\n7. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are golden brown.\n8. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\nI hope this menu suggestion helps!

Read the recipes thoroughly: Before you start cooking, make sure to read through each recipe carefully. Familiarize yourself with the steps and gather all the necessary ingredients and equipment.\n\n2. Prep ahead of time: To make the cooking process smoother, you can do some prep work in advance. For example, you can chop the onion and garlic, cook the rice, and even stuff the bell peppers a few hours before your friends arrive.\n\n3. Time management: Consider the cooking times for each dish and plan accordingly. Start with the stuffed bell peppers since they take the longest to cook. While they're in the oven, you can prepare the roasted garlic Parmesan potatoes. Lastly, bake the chocolate chip cookies while you're enjoying the main course.\n\n4. Taste as you go: Don't be afraid to taste the dishes as you cook and adjust the seasonings to your liking. This way, you can ensure everything is seasoned well and suits your taste preferences.\n\n5. Enjoy the process: Cooking for friends is not just about the end result but also about the experience itself. Have fun in the kitchen, experiment, and don't be afraid to make mistakes.
