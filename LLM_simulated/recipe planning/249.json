Instead of the usual cocktail sauce, we can make a zesty avocado-lime dressing to complement the shrimp. It's simple to prepare and adds a lovely touch of elegance.\n\nFor the main course, since you mentioned a high-quality protein, I recommend preparing a perfectly seared filet mignon. It's a classic choice that never disappoints. You can season the steak with salt, pepper, and a bit of garlic powder, then sear it in a hot skillet with some butter and thyme. Serve it with a side of roasted asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes for a well-rounded meal.\n\nLastly, for dessert, how about a rich and indulgent chocolate lava cake? It's a decadent treat that's sure to impress. You can serve it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. The contrast between the warm, gooey chocolate and the cold, creamy topping is heavenly.\n\nDoes this sound like a plan? Let me know if you have any other preferences or if there's anything else I can assist you with!",
            "content_zh": "听起来像个很棒的计划！作为开胃菜，怎么样来个清新轻盈的菜肴，比如稍加改良的虾鸡尾酒？我们可以用一种开胃的鳄梨青柠沙拉酱来代替传统的调味酱，搭配虾肉。这种简单的制作方法让菜肴更加优雅。作为主菜，考虑到你提到要高质量的蛋白质，我建议做一个完美煎烤的菲力牛排。这是一个永远不会让人失望的经典之选。用盐、胡椒和一点蒜粉调味牛排，然后在热锅里加一些黄油和百里香煎至金黄。搭配一份烤芦笋和蒜蓉土豆泥，这是一个营养均衡的餐点。最后，甜点方面，怎么样来个浓郁诱人的巧克力岩浆蛋糕？这是一个十分奢华的款待，一定会给人留下深刻印象。你可以把它热着搭配一小勺香草冰淇淋或一块生奶油。热呼呼的巧克力和冰凉绵密的奶制品之间的对比感觉有如天堂。这个计划听起来如何？如果你有其他偏好或者需要我帮忙的地方，请随时告诉我！",
