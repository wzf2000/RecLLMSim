How about a hearty vegetable stir-fry with tofu? It's a versatile dish that allows you to use a variety of vegetables. \n\nFor the stir-fry, you'll need:\n\n- 1 block of firm tofu, drained and cubed\n- Assorted vegetables of your choice (such as bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, snap peas, or zucchini), sliced or chopped\n- 2 cloves of garlic, minced\n- 1 tablespoon of ginger, grated\n- 2 tablespoons of soy sauce (or tamari for a gluten-free option)\n- 1 tablespoon of sesame oil (or any other cooking oil)\n- Optional: 1 tablespoon of cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons of water (to thicken the sauce)\n\nTo prepare the stir-fry, follow these steps:\n\n1. Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.\n2. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant.\n3. Add the cubed tofu to the skillet and cook for a few minutes until it starts to brown.\n4. Add the vegetables to the skillet and stir-fry for 4-5 minutes until they are cooked but still crisp.\n5. In a small bowl, mix the soy sauce with the optional cornstarch slurry to create a sauce.\n6. Pour the sauce over the stir-fry and stir well to coat everything evenly. Cook for another minute until the sauce thickens.\n7. Serve the stir-fry over steamed rice or noodles.\n\nNow, let's think about a side dish to complement the stir-fry. How about a simple and refreshing cucumber salad? It's quick to prepare and adds a nice crunch to the meal.\n\nFor the cucumber salad, you'll need:\n\n- 2 cucumbers, thinly sliced\n- 1/4 cup rice vinegar\n- 1 tablespoon sugar (or alternative sweetener of your choice)\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n- Optional: sesame seeds or chopped fresh herbs for garnish (such as cilantro or mint)\n\nTo make the cucumber salad, follow these steps:\n\n1. In a bowl, mix together the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until the sugar and salt have dissolved.\n2. Add the sliced cucumbers to the bowl and toss them well in the dressing.\n3. Let the cucumber salad marinate in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes before serving.\n4. Garnish with sesame seeds or fresh herbs if desired.\n\nWith the stir-fry and cucumber salad, you'll have a well-balanced and delicious vegetarian meal. I hope you enjoy preparing and savoring it!
