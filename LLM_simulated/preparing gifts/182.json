Here are a few suggestions that might inspire you:\n\n1. Personalized photo album: Gather your favorite pictures together and create a photo album filled with memories you've shared. You can add captions or little notes to make it even more meaningful.\n\n2. DIY gift: Consider making something yourself, like a handwritten love letter, a scrapbook, or a customized piece of artwork. It shows thoughtfulness and effort, which can make a gift truly special.\n\n3. Plan a surprise date: Instead of a physical gift, plan a surprise date tailored to your boyfriend's interests. It could be a picnic in the park, a movie night at home with his favorite films, or a hike to a scenic spot. Spending quality time together can be a wonderful gift in itself.\n\n4. Subscription box: If your boyfriend has particular interests or hobbies, consider getting him a subscription box related to those interests. There are various options available, such as books, snacks, grooming products, or even a monthly vinyl record subscription.\n\n5. Personalized accessories: Look for personalized items like engraved keychains, cufflinks, or a customized phone case. These small but thoughtful gifts can be a daily reminder of your love.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose something that reflects your boyfriend's personality and interests. It's the thought and effort you put into the gift that will make it special. Good luck, and I hope you find the perfect gift for your boyfriend!",
            "content_zh": "你好！我很高兴能在这里帮助你选择情人节礼物。很棒你想要用合理的预算制造特殊的礼物。以下是一些建议，可能会给你一些启发：\n1. 个性化相册：收集你最喜欢的照片，制作一本充满你们共享过的回忆的相册。你可以添加标题或小笔记使其更有意义。\n2. DIY礼物：考虑自己制作一些东西，比如手写爱情信、拼贴画或定制的艺术品。这展现了周到和努力，可以使礼物变得非常特别。\n3. 策划一个惊喜约会：不要物质礼物，而是策划一个根据你男朋友兴趣量身定制的惊喜约会。比如在公园野餐、在家看他最喜欢的电影晚上，或者徒步到一个风景优美的地方去。共度美好时光也可以是一个非常美妙的礼物。\n4. 会员订阅盒：如果你男朋友有特别的兴趣爱好，考虑给他买一个相关的会员订阅盒。例如书籍、小食品、美容产品，甚至是一个每月一次的黑胶唱片订阅。\n5. 个性化配饰：寻找个性化的物品，比如刻有名字的钥匙扣、袖扣或定制的手机壳。这些小而周到的礼物可以每天提醒你的爱。\n记住，最重要的是选择与你男朋友的个性和兴趣相符的东西。是你在礼物中付出的心思和努力会使其变得特别。祝好运，希望你找到完美的礼物给你男朋友！",
