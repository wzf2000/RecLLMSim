It's great that you want to make it special while keeping it within a reasonable budget. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Personalized photo album: Gather your favorite pictures together and create a custom photo album. You can include memories from your time together, along with heartfelt messages and captions.\n\n2. Homemade treats: Get creative in the kitchen and bake some delicious homemade treats like cookies, cupcakes, or a cake. You can decorate them with Valentine's Day-themed designs or even write a sweet message on top.\n\n3. Customized gift: Consider getting a personalized item such as a custom-made keychain, engraved jewelry, or a monogrammed accessory. It adds a personal touch and shows thoughtfulness.\n\n4. Plan a surprise date night: Organize a special evening for the two of you. It could be a candlelit dinner at home, a picnic in the park, or even a movie night with all their favorite films. Put effort into creating a romantic atmosphere.\n\n5. Experience or activity: Instead of a physical gift, you could plan a fun experience or activity that you can enjoy together. It could be something like a couple's spa day, a cooking class, or even a day trip to a nearby town or city.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your love and thoughtfulness. It's the effort and sentiment behind the gift that truly matters. Good luck, and I hope you have a wonderful Valentine's Day!",
