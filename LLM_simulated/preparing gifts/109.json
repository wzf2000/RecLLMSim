It could be a customized mug, a keychain, or even a personalized pen.\n\n2. Handwritten note: A heartfelt message expressing your gratitude and admiration can be a meaningful gift. It shows that you've taken the time to think about your teacher and their impact on you.\n\n3. Gift cards: If you're unsure about your teacher's preferences, a gift card to a bookstore, a coffee shop, or a restaurant could be a safe and versatile option.\n\n4. Classroom supplies: Teachers often spend their own money on supplies, so practical gifts like stationery, markers, or even a whiteboard can be appreciated.\n\n5. Books: If your teacher loves reading, consider gifting them a book related to their subject or a favorite genre. It's a thoughtful gesture that shows you value their passion for knowledge.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is the sentiment behind the gift. Whatever you choose, make sure it comes from the heart and reflects your gratitude for your teacher's hard work and dedication.",
