Customized accessories: Consider getting him a personalized keychain, wallet, or phone case. You can have his initials or a special message engraved on it to add a personal touch.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose a gift that shows your thoughtfulness and reflects his interests and personality. I hope these ideas inspire you, and I'm sure whatever you decide on will be appreciated!",
