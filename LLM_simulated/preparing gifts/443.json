Handwritten note: A heartfelt message expressing your gratitude and appreciation can be a wonderful gift. You can write it on a nice card or even create a personalized letter. It shows that you've taken the time to reflect on your teacher's impact on your life.\n\n2. DIY personalized mug: Purchase a plain white mug and use ceramic markers or paint to create a personalized design. You can write your teacher's name, draw something related to their subject, or include a meaningful quote. It's a practical and personalized gift they can use every day.\n\n3. Homemade treats: If your teacher enjoys baked goods, consider making some homemade treats like cookies, brownies, or cupcakes. Package them nicely in a box or a jar with a heartfelt note. It shows your effort and thoughtfulness.\n\n4. Classroom supplies: Teachers often spend their own money on classroom supplies, so consider gifting some useful items like colorful pens, sticky notes, or a nice notebook. These practical gifts can be appreciated and put to good use.\n\n5. Book or bookmark: If your teacher is an avid reader, consider gifting them a book related to their interests or their subject. Alternatively, you could make a personalized bookmark with a thoughtful message or a design that represents something they love.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your appreciation and thoughtfulness. It's the sentiment behind the gift that truly matters. Good luck with your gift preparation, and I'm sure your teacher will appreciate whatever you choose!",

DIY个性化马克杯：购买一个普通的白色马克杯，使用陶瓷笔或油漆来创作个性化的设计。您可以写上老师的名字，画一些与他们所教科目相关的内容，或加入一句有意义的引言。这是一份实用且个性化的礼物，他们每天都可以使用。\n3. 自制美食：如果您的老师喜欢烘焙食品，考虑制作一些自制美食，例如饼干、布朗尼或蛋糕。将它们用一个漂亮的盒子或罐子包装好，附上一张真诚的便条。这展示了您的努力和体贴。\n4. 课堂用品：老师经常花钱购买课堂用品，因此考虑赠送一些有用的物品，如彩色笔、便条纸或漂亮的笔记本。这些实用的礼物可以被欣赏和好好利用。\n5. 书籍或书签：如果您的老师是一个热爱阅读的人，请考虑赠送他们一本与他们的兴趣或所教科目相关的书籍。或者，您可以制作一个带有体贴信息或代表他们所热爱事物的设计的个性化书签。\n请记住，最重要的是展示您的感激和体贴。真正重要的是礼物背后的情感。祝您的礼物准备顺利，我相信您的老师会喜欢您选择的任何礼物！",
