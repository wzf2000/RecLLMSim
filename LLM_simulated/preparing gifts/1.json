Science Experiment Kits: Look for kits that allow him to conduct fun and educational experiments at home. There are various options available, such as chemistry sets, crystal-growing kits, or even kits focused on specific areas like astronomy or geology.\n\n2. Microscope: Consider getting him a beginner's microscope that will allow him to explore the microscopic world. It can be a fascinating tool for observing cells, insects, or even small everyday objects.\n\n3. Nature Exploration Kit: Put together a kit that includes items like a magnifying glass, a small notebook for observations, a field guide to local plants and wildlife, and maybe even a bug-catching kit. This will encourage him to explore the outdoors and learn more about the natural world.\n\n4. Science Books: Look for age-appropriate books that cover a range of scientific topics. There are many engaging and visually appealing books that explain scientific concepts in a fun and accessible way.\n\n5. DIY Science Projects: Consider a subscription to a science-themed monthly box that delivers hands-on experiments and projects to his doorstep. These subscriptions often include materials and instructions for exciting experiments that he can do at home.\n\nRemember, it's not just about the gift itself, but also the experience and learning opportunities it provides. I hope these ideas help you find something special for your nephew within your budget!",
