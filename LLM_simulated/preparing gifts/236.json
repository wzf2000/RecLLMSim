Here are a few suggestions that might inspire you:\n\n1. Personalized photo album: Gather your favorite memories together and create a customized photo album. You could include pictures, handwritten notes, and even small mementos from your time together.\n\n2. DIY gift: Consider making something from scratch, like a homemade candle, a knitted scarf, or a personalized playlist. Handmade gifts often have a unique and sentimental touch that shows you put thought and effort into it.\n\n3. Experiences over material things: Instead of a physical gift, plan a special day or evening together. It could be a picnic in the park, a surprise date, or a fun activity like going to a cooking class or a concert.\n\n4. Subscription box: If your boyfriend has a particular hobby or interest, you could get him a subscription box tailored to that. Whether it's a monthly book subscription, a craft beer box, or a grooming kit, it's a gift that keeps on giving throughout the year.\n\n5. Engraved or personalized item: Consider getting something that can be engraved or personalized, such as a watch, a wallet, or a piece of jewelry. Adding a special message or his initials can make it even more meaningful.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose something that reflects your boyfriend's interests and personality. Think about what he enjoys and what would make him feel loved and appreciated. Good luck, and I hope you find the perfect gift!",
            "content_zh": "你好！我很乐意帮助你想出一些特别体贴的情人节礼物给你的男朋友。以下是一些可能会启发你的建议：\n\n1. 个性化相册：收集你们喜欢的回忆并创建一本定制的相册。你可以包括照片、手写便条，甚至是一些在一起的小纪念品。\n\n2. 手工礼物：考虑从头做一些东西，比如自制蜡烛、手工编织围巾或个性化播放列表。手工礼物通常具有独特而感人的特点，显示出你的用心和努力。\n\n3. 体验胜过物质：而不是送实物礼物，计划一个特别的一天或一个晚上在一起。可以是在公园野餐、一个惊喜约会，或者一个有趣的活动，比如参加烹饪课或音乐会。\n\n4. 订阅盒子：如果你的男友有特别爱好或兴趣，你可以给他一个专门定制的订阅盒子。无论是每月一本书的订阅、手工啤酒盒子还是修容套装，都是一份全年持续给予的礼物。\n\n5. 雕刻或个性化物品：考虑买一些可以雕刻或个性化的东西，比如手表、钱包或珠宝。加上一段特别的信息或他的首字母会让它变得更有意义。\n\n记住，最重要的是选择能反映你男朋友兴趣和个性的东西。想想他喜欢什么以及什么会让他感到被爱和被珍视。祝你好运，希望你找到最完美的礼物！",

You could even set up a candlelit table and create a cozy ambiance. Cooking together can also be a fun and intimate activity.\n\n5. Thoughtful gestures: Sometimes, it's the small gestures that mean the most. Consider writing him a heartfelt letter expressing your feelings, planning a surprise date night at home, or organizing a game night with his friends.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your boyfriend that you've put thought into the gift and that it comes from the heart.
