This can be a great way for him to explore aviation in a fun and interactive way.\n\n5. Airplane Puzzle: Puzzles are not only entertaining but also help develop problem-solving skills. Look for a puzzle featuring airplanes or airports to keep him engaged and challenged.\n\nRemember, it's the thought that counts, so any gift that reflects his interest in aviation will likely be appreciated.
