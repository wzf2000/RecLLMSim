It seems like a well-rounded plan to get started on my French learning journey. I'll definitely set clear goals and make sure to practice all the different aspects of the language.\n\nRegarding the resources, I'm particularly interested in trying out the Duolingo app and using flashcards to memorize vocabulary.

What do you think?\n\nAdditionally, I'd like to know if there are any specific time commitments I should consider for each learning activity.

Using the Duolingo app and flashcards for vocabulary memorization are great choices to start with.\n\nLabeling objects around your apartment with their French names is an excellent idea! It's a simple yet effective way to immerse yourself in the language and reinforce your learning. Plus, you'll see those labels every day, which will help you remember the words more easily.\n\nAs for time commitments, consistency is key when learning a new language. It's better to study for shorter periods every day than to cram everything into a few long study sessions. Aim for at least 15-30 minutes of focused study each day, and gradually increase the time as you progress. Consistency will help you build a habit and retain what you learn.\n\nAdditionally, try to find moments throughout the day to incorporate French into your routine. For example, you can listen to French podcasts during your commute, practice speaking while doing chores, or read a few pages of a French book before bed. These small daily interactions with the language will make a significant difference in your progress.\n\nRemember, learning a language is a journey, so be patient and enjoy the process. Good luck with your French studies, and feel free to reach out if you have any more questions along the way!",
