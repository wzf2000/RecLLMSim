            "content": "You've got it! Here's the suggested order for preparing the dishes:\n\n1. Start with the Caprese Salad: It's a simple and refreshing appetizer that requires minimal cooking. Begin by slicing the tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. Arrange them on a plate, alternating between tomato and mozzarella slices. Tuck fresh basil leaves in between. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\n2. Move on to the Spaghetti Bolognese: This classic pasta dish is hearty and flavorful. Begin by cooking the spaghetti according to the package instructions. While the pasta is cooking, sauté the onion and garlic in a pan until they become translucent. Add the ground beef (or vegetarian alternative) and cook until browned. Stir in the tomato sauce, tomato paste, and Italian herbs. Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the Bolognese sauce over the cooked spaghetti and garnish with grated Parmesan cheese if desired.\n\n3. Finish with the Tiramisu: This elegant dessert requires some assembly and chilling time. Start by brewing a strong cup of coffee or espresso and letting it cool. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the mascarpone cheese, eggs, and sugar until smooth. Dip each ladyfinger cookie into the cooled coffee or espresso and layer them in a dish. Spread a layer of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers. Repeat the layers until you run out of ingredients, finishing with a layer of mascarpone on top. Dust the top with cocoa powder. Refrigerate the Tiramisu for at least 4 hours or overnight to allow the flavors to develop.\n\nRemember to take your time, follow the recipes step by step, and enjoy the process. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any more questions along the way. Happy cooking!",
            "content_zh": "你做到了！以下是准备这些菜的建议顺序：\n\n1. 先来一份卡普雷塞沙拉：这是一个简单清爽的开胃菜，几乎不需要烹饪。首先切番茄和马苏里拉奶酪。将它们交替地摆放在盘子上，夹入新鲜甜罗勒叶。淋上特级初榨橄榄油和香醋。根据口味撒上盐和胡椒。\n\n2. 接下来做博洛尼亚式肉酱意大利面：这经典的意大利面菜香气四溢。首先按包装上的说明煮熟意大利面。在意大利面煮的时候，在锅里炒洋葱和大蒜直至半透明。加入羊肉酱（或素食替代品），煮至变色。搅拌番茄酱、番茄酱和意大利香料。焖煮约15-20分钟，让风味融合。根据口味加盐和胡椒。将博洛尼亚酱倒在煮熟的意大利面上，如有需要，撒上磨碎的帕尔玛干酪装饰。\n\n3. 最后做提拉米苏：这款优雅的甜点需要一些组装和冷藏时间。首先冲一杯浓咖啡或浓缩咖啡，让其变凉。在一个大碗中，搅拌起马斯卡彭奶酪、鸡蛋和糖直至顺滑。将每块手指饼干浸入凉了的咖啡或浓缩咖啡，叠放在容器中。在手指饼干上放一层奶酪混合物。重复层叠直至材料用完，最后一层是奶酪混合物。在顶部撒上一层可可粉。将提拉米苏冷藏至少4小时或隔夜以便风味混合。\n\n记得慢慢来，严格按照步骤来，享受这个过程。如果有任何问题，请随时问。祝愉快！",
