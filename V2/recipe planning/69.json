            "content": "Great! How about a delicious and nutritious meal featuring baked salmon as the main protein? Salmon is not only rich in protein but also packed with omega-3 fatty acids, which are beneficial for brain health. To keep it quick and easy, we can pair the salmon with some roasted vegetables and a side of quinoa.\n\nHere's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\nBaked Salmon with Roasted Vegetables and Quinoa\n\nIngredients:\n- 2 salmon fillets\n- 2 cups mixed vegetables (such as bell peppers, zucchini, and cherry tomatoes)\n- 1 cup quinoa\n- 2 cups water or vegetable broth\n- Olive oil\n- Salt and pepper\n- Lemon wedges (optional, for serving)\n\nInstructions:\n1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).\n2. Rinse the quinoa under cold water and drain well.\n3. In a saucepan, combine the quinoa and water (or vegetable broth) and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover, and let it simmer for about 15 minutes or until the quinoa is tender and the water is absorbed. Fluff the quinoa with a fork and set aside.\n4. Meanwhile, prepare the vegetables by cutting them into bite-sized pieces.\n5. Place the vegetables on a baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat evenly.\n6. Place the salmon fillets on a separate baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper.\n7. Bake the vegetables and salmon in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes or until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.\n8. Once everything is ready, serve the baked salmon on a bed of quinoa, with the roasted vegetables on the side. Squeeze some fresh lemon juice over the salmon if desired.\n\nThis recipe is simple, healthy, and should take around 30 minutes to prepare. Feel free to adjust the seasoning or add any additional herbs or spices to suit your taste. Enjoy your homemade protein-rich meal!",
