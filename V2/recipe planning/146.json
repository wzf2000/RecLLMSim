Vegetarian Moussaka:\n   - Slice the eggplant, zucchini, and potatoes into thin rounds.\n   - Preheat the oven and roast the sliced vegetables until tender and slightly golden.\n   - Meanwhile, prepare a tomato sauce by sautéing onions and garlic, then adding diced tomatoes and herbs. Simmer until the sauce thickens.\n   - In a baking dish, layer the roasted vegetables and tomato sauce, repeating until all the ingredients are used.\n   - Prepare the béchamel sauce by melting butter, adding flour to make a roux, then gradually whisking in milk until thickened. Stir in grated cheese.\n   - Pour the béchamel sauce over the layered vegetables and bake until golden and bubbly. Allow it to rest for a few minutes before serving.\n\n5. Lemon and Herb Roasted Potatoes:\n   - Preheat the oven and cut the potatoes into bite-sized pieces.\n   - Toss the potatoes with olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, and a mixture of herbs like rosemary and thyme.\n   - Spread the potatoes on a baking sheet and roast until crispy and golden brown.

Toss everything together and adjust the seasoning to taste.\n\n7. Baklava:\n   - Thaw the phyllo dough according to package instructions.\n   - In a food processor, pulse the nuts until coarsely chopped.\n   - Melt the butter and brush it onto a baking dish.\n   - Layer the phyllo dough sheets, brushing each layer with melted butter and sprinkling a nut mixture in between.\n   - Once the layers are complete, score the top with a sharp knife into diamond or square shapes.\n   - Bake until golden brown and crisp.\n   - While the baklava is baking, prepare a syrup by combining sugar, water, lemon juice, and honey. Simmer until the sugar dissolves.\n   - Once the baklava is out of the oven, pour the syrup over it while it's still hot. Allow it to cool and absorb the syrup before serving.\n\nRemember to allocate enough time for each dish and plan your preparation accordingly. Some dishes can be made ahead of time, like the marinated olives and roasted red peppers, hummus, and even the baklava. This will help you manage your time and ensure everything is ready for your birthday celebration.\n\nI hope these steps and tips are helpful for you. If you have any further questions or need clarification on anything, feel free to ask. Happy cooking, and I wish you a fantastic birthday celebration with your friends!",
