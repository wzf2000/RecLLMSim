Caprese Skewers: Skewer cherry tomatoes, fresh mozzarella balls, and basil leaves. Drizzle with balsamic glaze.\n2. Spinach and Artichoke Dip: Serve with tortilla chips or bread slices.\n3. Bruschetta: Toasted baguette slices topped with diced tomatoes, basil, garlic, and a drizzle of olive oil.\n\nMain Courses:\n1. Veggie Stir-Fry: Sauté a mix of colorful vegetables like bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, and snap peas. Serve with steamed rice or noodles.\n2. Margherita Pizza: Make homemade pizza dough and top it with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil leaves.\n3. Stuffed Bell Peppers: Fill bell peppers with a mixture of cooked quinoa, black beans, corn, and cheese. Bake until tender.\n\nDesserts:\n1. Mini Fruit Tarts: Use pre-made tart shells and fill them with a mixture of whipped cream and your favorite fruits like berries or sliced peaches.\n2. Chocolate-dipped Strawberries: Melt some chocolate, dip fresh strawberries in it, and let them cool on parchment paper.\n3. Banana Split Bar: Set up a DIY banana split station with sliced bananas, various ice cream flavors, toppings like chocolate sauce, whipped cream, nuts, and cherries.\n\nNow, let's discuss the order of preparation. It's best to start with the dishes that can be made ahead of time or require minimal effort during the party. For example, you can prepare the Spinach and Artichoke Dip, Caprese Skewers, and Bruschetta in advance and refrigerate them until the party.\n\nNext, move on to the main courses. Start by preparing the dough for the Margherita Pizza, as it will need time to rise. While the dough is rising, you can work on the Stuffed Bell Peppers and the Veggie Stir-Fry.\n\nLastly, focus on the desserts. Prepare the Mini Fruit Tarts ahead of time and keep them chilled. Just before serving, dip the strawberries in chocolate and let them cool. Set up the Banana Split Bar with all the toppings and let your guests customize their desserts.\n\nBy following this order, you'll have a balanced meal and be able to enjoy the celebration with your friends without feeling overwhelmed. I hope this helps, and I wish you a fantastic birthday celebration! Let me know if you need any further assistance.",
