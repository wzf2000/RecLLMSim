How about we start with a three-course menu consisting of an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert? Here's an idea for each course:\n\n1. Appetizer: Prosciutto-wrapped Asparagus\n   - Ingredients: Asparagus, prosciutto, olive oil, salt, pepper\n   - Instructions: Wrap each asparagus spear with a slice of prosciutto. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven at 400°F (200°C) for about 10-12 minutes until the asparagus is tender and the prosciutto is crispy. Serve warm.\n\n2. Main Course: Herb-Crusted Salmon with Lemon Butter Sauce\n   - Ingredients: Salmon fillets, fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and dill), bread crumbs, butter, lemon juice, salt, pepper\n   - Instructions: Season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper. In a separate bowl, mix the fresh herbs and bread crumbs. Press the herb mixture onto the salmon fillets to create a crust. Heat some butter in a pan over medium-high heat and sear the salmon, crust-side down, for a few minutes until golden. Flip the fillets and cook for a few more minutes until the salmon is cooked through. Remove the salmon from the pan and deglaze it with lemon juice and more butter to make a delicious lemon butter sauce. Serve the salmon with the sauce.\n\n3. Dessert: Chocolate Mousse\n   - Ingredients: Dark chocolate, eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, whipped cream\n   - Instructions: Melt the dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl over simmering water. Separate the egg yolks and whites. In a mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks with sugar and vanilla extract until creamy. Slowly pour the melted chocolate into the egg yolk mixture, stirring constantly. In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture, then fold in the egg whites. Divide the mousse into serving glasses and refrigerate for a few hours until set. Serve chilled with a dollop of whipped cream on top.\n\nThese dishes should provide a protein-rich and elegant dining experience for you and your friends.
