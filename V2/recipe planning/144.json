How about we create a menu that includes a mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes? Here's a suggestion for a three-course meal:\n\nAppetizer: Bruschetta with Tomato and Basil\n\nIngredients:\n- Baguette or Italian bread\n- Ripe tomatoes\n- Fresh basil leaves\n- Garlic cloves\n- Olive oil\n- Salt and pepper\n\nInstructions:\n1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).\n2. Slice the baguette into half-inch thick slices and place them on a baking sheet.\n3. Drizzle olive oil over the bread slices and toast them in the oven until they turn golden and crispy.\n4. In the meantime, dice the tomatoes and chop the basil leaves.\n5. In a bowl, mix the tomatoes, basil, minced garlic, salt, pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil.\n6. Once the bread is toasted, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly.\n7. Spoon the tomato and basil mixture onto the bread slices and serve as an appetizer.\n\nMain Course: Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken with Roasted Vegetables\n\nIngredients:\n- Whole chicken\n- Lemons\n- Fresh herbs (such as rosemary, thyme, or parsley)\n- Garlic cloves\n- Olive oil\n- Salt and pepper\n- Assorted vegetables (carrots, potatoes, Brussels sprouts, etc.)\n\nInstructions:\n1. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).\n2. Rinse the chicken and pat it dry with paper towels.\n3. Stuff the cavity of the chicken with lemon wedges, fresh herbs, and garlic cloves.\n4. Rub the chicken with olive oil, salt, and pepper, ensuring it's evenly coated.\n5. Place the chicken in a roasting pan and roast it in the preheated oven for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).\n6. While the chicken is roasting, prepare the vegetables by cutting them into bite-sized pieces.\n7. Toss the vegetables with olive oil, salt, and pepper.\n8. After the chicken has roasted for about 30 minutes, add the vegetables to the same roasting pan and continue roasting until both the chicken and vegetables are cooked through and golden brown.\n\nDessert: Chocolate Mousse\n\nIngredients:\n- Dark chocolate\n- Heavy cream\n- Sugar\n- Vanilla extract\n- Whipped cream and chocolate shavings (optional, for garnish)\n\nInstructions:\n1. Melt the dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl over simmering water or in short bursts in the microwave.\n2. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla extract until soft peaks form.\n3. Gently fold the melted chocolate into the whipped cream until well combined.\n4. Divide the mousse into serving glasses or bowls and refrigerate for at least 2 hours to set.\n5. Before serving, you can garnish the mousse with whipped cream and chocolate shavings if desired.\n\nI hope this menu sounds appealing to you and your friends!
