It's a flavorful and elegant dish that's sure to impress your loved one. Here's a recipe for you:\n\nIngredients:\n- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n- Salt and pepper, to taste\n- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter\n- 1/2 cup chicken broth\n- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice\n- 1/4 cup capers, drained\n- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped\n\nInstructions:\n1. Start by preparing the chicken breasts. Place them between two sheets of plastic wrap and gently pound them to an even thickness. Season both sides with salt and pepper.\n2. Dredge the chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess.\n3. Heat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the butter has melted and the pan is hot, add the chicken breasts.\n4. Cook the chicken for about 3-4 minutes on each side until they are golden brown. Remove them from the skillet and set aside.\n5. In the same skillet, add the chicken broth, lemon juice, and capers. Bring the sauce to a simmer, scraping the bottom of the pan to incorporate any browned bits.\n6. Return the chicken breasts to the skillet and simmer for an additional 5 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has slightly thickened.\n7. Serve the chicken piccata on a plate, spooning the sauce over the top. Garnish with fresh parsley.\n\nYou can pair this dish with some roasted potatoes or pasta and a side of steamed vegetables. And don't forget a nice bottle of Italian wine to complete the romantic atmosphere! Enjoy your special dinner together!",
