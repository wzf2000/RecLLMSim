Finding a balance between a thoughtful and affordable gift is definitely possible. Here are a few ideas that could help:\n\n1. Handwritten note: A heartfelt message expressing your gratitude can be incredibly meaningful. Take the time to write a sincere letter, sharing specific instances where your teacher made a positive impact on you.\n\n2. DIY gift: Get creative and make something unique. You could consider crafting a personalized bookmark, a photo collage, or a small potted plant. DIY gifts often show thoughtfulness and effort, which can make them extra special.\n\n3. Class gift: Collaborate with your classmates to pool resources and create a collective gift. It could be a small token, like a customized mug or a framed class photo. This way, you can show appreciation as a group without the burden of individual expenses.\n\n4. Gift card or voucher: If you know your teacher's interests, you could get a gift card or voucher for a store or restaurant they enjoy. This allows them to choose something they like, and it doesn't have to be too expensive.\n\nRemember, the most important aspect is the sentiment behind the gift. Teachers appreciate the thought and effort you put into recognizing their hard work. Good luck, and I hope your teacher appreciates whatever you decide to give!",
