It's great to hear that you're considering both the sentiment and your budget. Here are a few suggestions that might help:\n\n1. Handmade crafts: Consider making a personalized card, a photo album, or a scrapbook filled with cherished memories. Handmade gifts often have a special touch that shows thoughtfulness and effort.\n\n2. Baked goods: If your grandmother enjoys sweets, you could bake her favorite treats. It could be cookies, a cake, or even traditional Chinese pastries associated with the festival, like chrysanthemum cakes. The time and effort you put into baking will surely be appreciated.\n\n3. Personalized jewelry: A piece of jewelry with her birthstone or a pendant with her initials can be a meaningful and lasting gift. You can find affordable options online or at local jewelry stores.\n\n4. Potted plants or flowers: A beautiful potted plant or a bouquet of flowers can brighten up her living space and bring a sense of joy. Choose plants or flowers that she likes or ones that symbolize good luck and longevity.\n\n5. Time together: Sometimes the most meaningful gift is spending quality time with loved ones. Plan a special outing or a day dedicated to doing activities she enjoys. It could be a picnic, a visit to a local attraction, or simply having a heartfelt conversation.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your love and appreciation for your grandmother. Whatever you decide, I'm sure she will treasure it because it comes from you.",
