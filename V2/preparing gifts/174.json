Personalized gift: Consider a personalized item like a custom-made mug, keychain, or photo frame. You could include a picture of you and your teacher or a memorable quote that represents your time together.\n\n3. Gift cards: If you're unsure about their preferences, a gift card to a bookstore, stationery shop, or a local coffee shop can be a great option. This way, your teacher can choose something they truly enjoy.\n\n4. Classroom supplies: Teachers often spend their own money on supplies, so consider gifting items like colorful pens, sticky notes, or a nice notebook. These practical gifts can be both useful and appreciated.\n\n5. Books: If you know your teacher's interests, consider gifting a book related to their subject or a book they might enjoy reading in their free time. You could also include a heartfelt note explaining why you chose that particular book.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your appreciation and thoughtfulness. Whatever you choose, your teacher will surely appreciate the gesture and the effort you put into making their day special.",
