Thoughtful gifts are always appreciated, so here are a few suggestions that are both meaningful and budget-friendly:\n\n1. Handwritten letter: Write a heartfelt letter expressing your gratitude and appreciation for your teacher's guidance and support. It's a personal and touching gesture that shows you've taken the time to reflect on their impact.\n\n2. DIY personalized bookmark: Create a unique bookmark by decorating a plain one with your teacher's name, favorite quotes, or drawings. It's a practical gift that shows you've considered their interests.\n\n3. Potted plant or flowers: A small potted plant or a bouquet of flowers can brighten up your teacher's day. Choose their favorite plant or flowers, or opt for low-maintenance options like succulents or air plants.\n\n4. Homemade treats: If you enjoy baking, consider making some homemade cookies, brownies, or other treats. Package them nicely and include a handwritten note to add a personal touch.\n\n5. Classroom supplies: Teachers often spend their own money on classroom supplies. Consider gifting them some useful items like colorful markers, sticky notes, or a personalized notepad. It's practical and shows you care about their work environment.\n\n6. Book or journal: If you know your teacher's interests, a book related to their subject or a journal can be a thoughtful gift. It shows you appreciate their passion for teaching and encourages their personal growth.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is the thought behind the gift. Choose something that reflects your teacher's personality and interests, and it will surely be appreciated. Good luck with your gift preparation!",

DIY 个性化书签：通过装饰普通书签，添加老师的名字、喜爱的引语或画作，创造一个独特的书签。这是一份实用的礼物，表明你考虑了他们的兴趣。3. 盆栽植物或鲜花：一小盆植物或一束鲜花可以照亮老师的一天。选择他们喜欢的植物或花卉，或选择多肉植物或空气植物等低维护选项。4. 自制美食：如果你喜欢烘焙，考虑制作一些自制饼干、布朗尼或其他点心。精心包装并附上手写便条，增添个人风格。5. 教室用品：老师经常用自己的钱购买教室用品。考虑送给他们一些有用的物品，如彩色记号笔、便利贴或个性化记事本。这是实用的，表明你关心他们的工作环境。6. 书或日记本：如果你了解老师的兴趣，赠送一本与他们学科相关的书或一本日记本是一种体贴的礼物。这表明你欣赏他们对教学的热情，并鼓励他们的个人成长。记住，最重要的是礼物背后的用心。选择能体现你老师个性和兴趣的东西，肯定会受到赏识。祝你准备礼物顺利！",
