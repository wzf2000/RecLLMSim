Science Experiment Kits: Look for age-appropriate science kits that allow him to conduct experiments at home. There are plenty of options available, ranging from chemistry sets to physics kits. These can be both educational and entertaining.\n\n2. Outdoor Exploration Gear: Encourage his love for the outdoors by gifting him some exploration gear. Consider items like a compass, a magnifying glass, a bug-catching kit, or a nature journal. These tools will enable him to observe and document his outdoor discoveries.\n\n3. Adventure Books: Since he enjoys adventure books, consider getting him a series or a collection of books that fuel his imagination and take him on exciting journeys. You could look into classics like \"The Hardy Boys\" or \"The Chronicles of Narnia,\" or explore more contemporary options like the \"Percy Jackson\" series.\n\n4. DIY Science Projects: Another idea is to give him a DIY science project book or a subscription to a science magazine for kids. These resources often include hands-on experiments and projects that he can explore independently.\n\n5. Outdoor Activity Set: Look for a gift that encourages outdoor play and physical activity. This could be a sports set, a kite, a remote-controlled airplane, or even a beginner's telescope for stargazing.\n\nRemember, the best gift is one that reflects his interests and sparks his curiosity. I hope these ideas help you find the perfect gift for your nephew's birthday!",
            "content_zh": "太棒了！听起来你的侄子有一个好奇和冒险精神。以下是一些礼物想法，可能符合他的兴趣：\n\n1. 科学实验套装：寻找适合他年龄的科学套装，让他在家里进行实验。有很多选择可供选择，从化学套装到物理套装都有。这些既可以教育又可以娱乐。\n\n2. 户外探险装备：通过送他一些探险装备来鼓励他热爱户外活动。考虑如罗盘、放大镜、捉虫工具包或大自然日记等物品。这些工具将使他能够观察并记录他在户外的发现。\n\n3. 冒险书籍：既然他喜欢冒险书籍，考虑为他买一套或一系列激发他想象力并带他踏上激动旅程的书籍。你可以研究经典作品如《哈迪男孩》或《纳尼亚传奇》，或者探索更多当代选项如《波西杰克逊》系列。\n\n4. DIY科学项目：另一个想法是给他一本DIY科学项目书或一本儿童科学杂志的订阅。这些资源通常包括他可以独立探索的实践性实验和项目。\n\n5. 户外活动套装：寻找一份鼓励户外玩耍和体育锻炼的礼物。可以是一个运动套装、一个风筝、一个遥控飞机，甚至是一个初学者望远镜用于观星。\n\n记住，最好的礼物是那种反映他兴趣并激起他好奇心的礼物。希望这些想法能帮助你找到完美的礼物给你侄子的生日！",
