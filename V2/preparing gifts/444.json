You can include pictures from your first date, trips you've taken together, or special moments you've shared.\n   - Write captions or short anecdotes next to the photos to explain why they are significant to both of you.\n   - Decorate the pages with stickers, washi tape, or other embellishments that reflect your boyfriend's interests or your shared memories.\n   - Consider adding small mementos, like ticket stubs or dried flowers, to make the album more tactile and personal.\n\n2. Coupon book:\n   - Customize the coupons to suit your boyfriend's preferences and desires. Think about what he enjoys or what he might appreciate most.\n   - Use different colors or patterns for each coupon to make them visually appealing.\n   - Handwrite the coupons for a personal touch, or you can design and print them using online templates.\n   - Consider adding a few blank coupons for him to fill in with his own requests or ideas.\n   - Bind the coupons together with a ribbon or use a hole punch and a metal ring to keep them organized.\n\nRemember, the key is to make the gift reflect your unique relationship and show that you've put thought and effort into it. I'm sure your boyfriend will appreciate whatever you create. Have fun crafting your special gift, and I hope you both have a fantastic Valentine's Day!",
