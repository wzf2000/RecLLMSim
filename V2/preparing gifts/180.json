It's great that you want to make it meaningful and stay within a reasonable budget. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Personalized photo album: Collect your favorite memories together and create a photo album. You can add captions or little notes to make it even more special.\n\n2. DIY gift: Consider making something yourself, like a handwritten love letter, a scrapbook filled with mementos, or a custom piece of artwork. It shows thoughtfulness and effort.\n\n3. Experience gift: Plan a special date or outing that your boyfriend would enjoy. It could be a picnic in the park, a hike, a cooking class, or tickets to a concert or sports event (if feasible given the current circumstances).\n\n4. Subscription box: If your boyfriend has a particular hobby or interest, consider getting him a subscription box related to that. It could be anything from a book club subscription to a monthly delivery of grooming products or even a snack box.\n\n5. Customized item: Look for personalized items like engraved keychains, custom-made T-shirts, or a monogrammed wallet. These can be thoughtful and unique gifts.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your love and appreciation. It's not about the price tag but the sentiment behind the gift. I hope these ideas help, and I wish you a wonderful Valentine's Day celebration!",
            "content_zh": "你好！我过得很好，谢谢。我很乐意帮你想一些情人节给男朋友特别的礼物的主意。你想要让礼物有意义并且预算合理是很好的。以下是一些建议：\n1. 定制照片相册：收集你们在一起的美好回忆，制作一本相册。你可以添加说明或小笔记，让它变得更特别。\n2. 自制礼物：考虑自己制作一些东西，比如手写情书、充满纪念品的剪贴簿，或者定制的艺术品。这体现了周到和努力。\n3. 体验礼物：计划一次特别的约会或活动，你男朋友会喜欢的。可以是在公园野餐，徒步旅行，烹饪课，或是音乐会或体育赛事的门票（在目前情况下可行的情况下）。\n4. 订阅盒：如果你男朋友有特别的爱好或兴趣，考虑给他买一个相关的订阅盒。可以从读书俱乐部订阅到月度美容产品送货或零食盒。\n5. 定制物品：寻找个性化物品，如刻有名字的钥匙扣、定制T恤或带字母刻印的钱包。这些都是周到且独特的礼物。\n记住，最重要的是展现你的爱和感激之情。这不是关于价格标签，而是关于礼物背后的感情。希望这些建议有所帮助，祝你们度过一个美好的情人节！",
