Alternatively, an audiobook could be a great option if she prefers listening to stories.\n\n5. Quality time together: Sometimes the best gift is simply spending quality time with your loved ones. Plan a special outing or activity that you can enjoy together, such as a picnic in the park, a movie night, or a leisurely walk in a scenic area.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to consider your grandmother's interests and preferences.
