            "content": "Great, thank you for sharing these details! Here's a rough plan based on your preferences:\n\n**Transportation:**\nFlights from Los Angeles to Xi'an typically range from $400 to $800 round trip, depending on when you book and the airline. Let's estimate your flight cost at $600. \n\n**Accommodation:**\nThere are several mid-range hotels in Xi'an that are centrally located. One option is the Mercure Xi'an on Renmin Square, a 4-star hotel with rates around $60 per night. For your 5-night stay, that would total to $300.\n\n**Attractions:**\n1. Terracotta Army: This is a must-see in Xi'an. The entrance fee is about $22.\n2. Ancient City Wall: You can either walk or rent a bike to go around. The entrance fee is about $8.\n3. Additionally, consider visiting the Muslim Quarter, which is famous for its food. It's free to visit, but set aside some money for food and souvenirs.\n\n**Food and Nightlife:**\nXi'an is known for its delicious street food. The Muslim Quarter, in particular, is a paradise for food lovers. Try their famous Xi'an Burger (Rou Jia Mo), cold rice noodles, and lamb skewers. The average cost per day for meals can be around $20 if you stick to local spots.\n\nXi'an's nightlife is vibrant with several bars and clubs. As a DJ, you might want to check out 1+1 (Yi jia Yi), which is one of the most popular nightclubs. Average costs might come to around $30 per night if you're planning to party.\n\n**Transportation in Xi'an:**\nPublic transportation is quite convenient. You can take buses or the metro to most attractions. A transportation card costs around $15 and can be used for buses and metro.\n\n**Total estimated cost:**\n\n- Flight: $600\n- Accommodation: $300\n- Food: $100 (5 days x $20)\n- Nightlife: $150 (5 nights x $30)\n- Attractions: $30\n- Transportation Card: $15\n\nTotal: $1,195\n\nThis is well within your budget of $2000 and leaves you some extra for shopping, additional attractions, or unexpected expenses.\n\nDoes this plan sound good to you? If you have any changes or additional preferences, feel free to let me know!",

Aperture Club in Xi'an is a popular spot for underground and alternative music lovers. They often have live music and DJ sets.\n\nIn terms of music stores, you might want to check out the Qinmei Music Store. It's a combination of a café, a bookstore, and a vinyl record store, and it's a pretty popular spot for music lovers in the city.\n\nAs for getting around Xi'an, the city has an extensive metro system that covers most of the city, including many of the main attractions. Taxis are also available and quite affordable. However, many locals and tourists alike prefer to use Didi, which is China's version of Uber.\n\nThe Terracotta Army is located in Lintong District, around 40 km northeast of downtown Xi'an. The site is not accessible by metro, but there are several other options. The most popular and cost-effective way is to take a public bus (Tourist Bus Line 5 (306)) from Xi'an Railway Station. It costs around $1 for a one-way trip and takes about an hour. Alternatively, you can take a taxi or a Didi, but it would be considerably more expensive.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions or if there's anything else you'd like to know!",
