Since I can't browse real-time deals or make bookings directly, I'll provide you with strategies to secure the best options.\n\n### Flights from Washington D.C. to Xi'an\n\n1. **Use Flight Comparison Tools**: Websites like Skyscanner, Google Flights, and Kayak allow you to compare prices across different airlines. They also offer features to alert you when prices drop for your specified route.\n\n2. **Book in Advance**: For international trips, booking 2-3 months in advance can often secure you a better rate.\n\n3. **Check Airlines’ Official Sites**: After finding a good deal on a comparison site, check the airline's official site. Sometimes, they offer lower prices or more flexible booking options.\n\n4. **Consider Time of Day**: Flights early in the morning or late at night can sometimes be cheaper, though this might affect your comfort and convenience.\n\n5. **Non-Stop Flights**: Direct flights from Washington D.C. to Xi'an are limited, so you may need to be flexible with your travel dates to find a non-stop option. Check with airlines that operate extensive international routes, like Air China.\n\n### Booking at Sofitel Legend People's Grand Hotel Xi'an\n\n1. **Booking Platforms**: Start with hotel booking platforms such as Booking.com, Expedia, or Agoda. They often have competitive rates and good cancellation policies.\n\n2. **Hotel’s Official Website**: Visit the hotel’s official website to compare prices. Booking directly can sometimes offer better rates or added perks like free Wi-Fi, breakfast, or room upgrades.\n\n3. **Loyalty Programs**: If you're a member of AccorHotels’ loyalty program (Sofitel is part of AccorHotels), you might access exclusive deals or use points towards your stay.\n\n4. **Request a Room with a View**: During booking, specify your preference for a room with a good view. Follow up with a direct email or call to the hotel to reiterate your request. Hotels are often willing to accommodate special requests based on availability.\n\n5. **Check for Deals and Packages**: Look for any special deals or packages that include additional amenities such as spa access, dining credits, or late checkout. These can enhance your stay and provide more value for your money.\n\nRemember, prices and availability can change rapidly, so once you find a deal that matches your criteria, it's wise to book it sooner rather than later. Safe travels, and enjoy your trip to Xi'an! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.",
