There are regular high-speed trains running between the two cities, and the journey usually takes around 6 to 7 hours. Trains depart from Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station and arrive at Xi'an North Railway Station. \n\nThe timetable varies, but generally, the earliest train departs around 6:00 AM and the last one leaves around 6:00 PM. There are also overnight sleeper trains available if you prefer a night journey. I recommend booking your train tickets in advance to ensure availability.\n\nFor your accommodation, Xi'an has a variety of eco-friendly hotels to choose from. One recommendation would be the W Xian, which is known for its sustainable practices and is conveniently located to many historical sites.\n\nFor your daily itinerary, we can certainly plan visits to significant landmarks such as the Terracotta Warriors, Xi'an City Wall, and the Big Wild Goose Pagoda. Additionally, since you're interested in meditation and reading, the Great Mosque of Xi'an and the Shaanxi History Museum might also be of interest. \n\nXi'an is also home to several organic farms that offer farm tours and workshops. One such example is the Xi'an Banpo Village Organic Farm, which could tie in nicely with your interest in organic farming.\n\nConsidering your preference for vegan dining, Xi'an offers a variety of options. One popular vegan-friendly restaurant is the Pure Lotus Vegetarian, which serves organic food.\n\nWould you like me to provide more detailed information on any of these aspects?",
