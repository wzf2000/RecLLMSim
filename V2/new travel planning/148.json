You can also take part in a yoga retreat or unwind in the serenity of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The city is also renowned for its culinary scene, with healthy and organic options available at restaurants like Sweetwater Harvest Kitchen.\n\n2. **Asheville, North Carolina**: Asheville is a city in the Blue Ridge Mountains known for a vibrant arts scene and historic architecture. Visit the Biltmore Estate, a giant Gilded Age mansion, or the Downtown Art District, filled with galleries and museums. The city has a selection of boutique hotels and charming B&Bs, such as the Chestnut Street Inn. For food options, Asheville is a haven for organic, fresh, and locally-sourced fare.
