Let's start outlining your trip.\n\n### Transportation\n- **Flights**: Since you prefer to fly, I'll look for direct flights from Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK) or Beijing Daxing International Airport (PKX) to Xi'an Xianyang International Airport (XIY).

Some of the major airlines operating this route include Air China, China Eastern, and Hainan Airlines. Flight duration is approximately 2 hours 15 minutes. I would recommend an early morning flight on 15th July so you can make the most of your day in Xi'an, and an evening flight on 17th July to maximize your time before returning to Beijing.\n\n### Hotel Details:\n- **The Ritz-Carlton, Xi'an**: This luxury hotel boasts an indoor swimming pool, a fitness center, and various dining options. While it doesn't have a golf course on-site, the Xi'an International Golf Club is about a 30-minute drive away.\n- **Wyndham Grand Xian South**: This hotel offers a fitness center, a swimming pool, and multiple restaurants. The Xi'an Qujiang International Golf Club is approximately a 20-minute drive from this hotel.\n  \n### Guided Tour for Terracotta Army:\nThere are several guided tours available for the Terracotta Army. These tours usually include a knowledgeable guide who can explain the history and significance of the site, as well as transportation from your hotel. The duration is typically half a day. I would recommend booking a morning tour, as the site can get quite crowded in the afternoon.\n\n### Tang Dynasty Dinner Show:\nThis show is a combination of a Chinese dumpling banquet and a spectacular performance of music and dance from the Tang Dynasty. The show is held at the Tang Dynasty Palace, and pre-booking is recommended as it can sell out. Dinner usually starts around 6:30 PM, followed by the show at 8:30 PM. The entire experience lasts about 3 hours.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. Let me know if you need more details or if there's anything else you'd like to know.",
