Based on your preferences, here are a few destinations you might consider:\n\n1. **New Orleans, Louisiana, USA**: Known as the birthplace of jazz, New Orleans has a vibrant music scene with live performances happening every night in music clubs across the city. During the day, you can explore the French Quarter, visit the New Orleans Jazz Museum, and even take a steamboat tour on the Mississippi River with live jazz entertainment. December weather is also mild, with average highs of around 63°F (17°C).\n\n2. **Austin, Texas, USA**: Known as the \"Live Music Capital of the World\", Austin offers an array of venues featuring indie, country, rock, blues, and more. The city is known for its music festivals like Austin City Limits. In December, Austin's weather is typically mild.\n\n3. **Havana, Cuba**: If you're open to international travel, Havana could be a great choice. This city is known for its lively music scene, with salsa, rumba, and jazz pouring out from bars and clubs. You'll need to check visa requirements and travel advisories, though.\n\n4. **Seville, Spain**: Known for its flamenco scene, Seville can offer a unique traditional music experience. The city is full of tablaos (flamenco venues) and even offers flamenco dance classes. Since it's in Southern Spain, December weather is relatively mild but colder than the other options.\n\nFor your budget of $3000, considering flight costs, accommodation, food, and entertainment, I'd say domestic travel would be more comfortable. New Orleans or Austin would be a better fit, and you could split your two weeks between the two for a mix of jazz and indie music. However, we can look into Havana and Seville if you're interested in those. \n\nLet me know what you think, or if you have other preferences!",
